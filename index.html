		<h1>hello!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Matt Long, a twenty something guy who works in tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      I work as a Developer in Test at <a href="http://www.opencredo.com">OpenCredo</a>, an open-source software consultancy, and you can read a more professional work profile <a href="https://www.opencredo.com/company/people/matthew-long/">over here</a>. If I was really pressed to describe what I do, I would probably just say software developer, but that would lose the nuance that I specialise in testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in hiring me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/burythehammer">my LinkedIn profile</a> is the place to go.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I've become an awful blend of hipster and nerd. I'm a big fan of indiepop music, videogames, and arthouse cinema. I geocache a lot, and I'm interested in liberal politics and economics!
