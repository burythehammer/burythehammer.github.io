		<h1>hello!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Matt Long.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am a QA & devops consultant for <a href="https://opencredo.com/">OpenCredo</a>, an open source software consultancy based in London.
		</p>
		
		<p>I've worked as a QA consultant for many years, and built test automation frameworks in half a dozen programming languages. After working on many cloud infrastructure projects, I've become particularly interested in the intersection of modern cloud infrastructure and testing.		
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I have presented talks at QCon, TestBash, muCon, Agile Cambridge, and many smaller meetups across London. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In my spare time, I listen to indiepop music, play videogames, watch pretentious arthouse movies, and relentlessly quote The Simpsons. I also build and maintain a machine learning foosball bot!
		</p>
