		<h1>hello!</h1>
		<p>
			I'm Matt Long.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a software engineer and a senior consultant for <a href="https://opencredo.com/">OpenCredo</a>, an open source software consultancy based in London.
		</p>
		<p>
			I worked as a QA consultant for many years, and built test automation frameworks in half a dozen programming languages, including Go, Java, Javascript, and more. After working on many cloud infrastructure projects, I have made the leap to becoming a platform engineer. Given these dual specialities, I am particularly interested in the intersection of software testing and modern cloud technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have presented talks at QCon, TestBash, muCon, Agile Cambridge, and many smaller meetups across London. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a keen runner, an indiepop fan, and quote The Simpsons too much. I live in Shoreditch with my partner and an unbearably cute British shorthair kitten.
		</p>

			If you're interested in hiring me, or getting me to do a talk, get in touch via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/burythehammer">LinkedIn</a>.
