		<h1>hello!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Matt Long. I work in tech.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am a QA engineer for <a href="https://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>, based in London. I worked as a QA consultant for many years, and built test automation frameworks in half a dozen languages. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			My particular areas of expertise include cloud infrastructure, serverless architectures, API and web testing.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I have presented talks at QCon, TestBash, muCon, Agile Cambridge, and many smaller meetups across London.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my spare time, I listen to indiepop music, play videogames, watch pretentious arthouse movies, and also relentlessly quote The Simpsons. I also build and maintain a machine learning foosball bot!
