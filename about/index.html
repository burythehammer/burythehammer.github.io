		<h1>about</h1>
		<p>
      Hello! I'm Matt, a twenty something guy who works in tech, and likes discussing pop culture. This is my personal website, named after a relatively obscure Beat Happening song.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work as a QA/Developer-in-test at OpenCredo, an open-source software consultancy, and you can read a more professional work profile over here. If I was really pressed to describe what I do (say, on a quiz show, with Alexander Armstrong hoping I say something interesting), I would probably just say software developer, but that would lose the nuance that I specialise in testing. If you're interested in hiring me, LinkedIn is the place to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time, I try to avoid being both a hipster and a nerd, but I've generally not been too successful at either. I'm a big fan of indiepop music, videogames, and arthouse cinema. I geocache a lot, and I'm interested in liberal politics and economics!
