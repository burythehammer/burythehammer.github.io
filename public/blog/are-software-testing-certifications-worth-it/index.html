		<p>In principle, they could be. In practice, no.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done the ISTQB foundation. It was a case in memorising useless terminology and methodology that is at best outdated, and at worst completely irrelevant. It also seemed to see iterative development and automation as &lsquo;incredibly advanced&rsquo; (sigh) topics, which IMO does more damage to the industry than helps it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankfully at the point in my career where I have plenty of options available to me, but frankly, any job that requires me to have arbitrary useless qualifications is a warning sign more than an opportunity. If they don&rsquo;t put any thought into their interview criteria, what makes you think they put any thought into their software, or you once you join?</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about testing, work in more teams, learn some programming, do some coding side projects, read some books, attend meet ups and conferences. And be discerning.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do, honestly, is find a great company and/or team and prepare to learn and be mentored (easier said than done!).</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not the first person to think along these lines. This post by <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-testing-certification-ISTQB-CSTE-etc-worth-it-for-getting-testing-jobs-Are-there-any-best-options-for-QA/answer/Albert-Gareev">Albert Gareev</a> is much more elequont than I am, and Martin Fowler (for it is he) has also talked about <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CertificationCompetenceCorrelation.html">the problem with technical certifications</a>.</p>
