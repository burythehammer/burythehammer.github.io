		<p>After four years, I&rsquo;m leaving Haringey.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll miss more. Maybe the attentive but racist and sexist landlord. Maybe the constant creeping of mould. Then there&rsquo;s the gross avocado-coloured bathroom fittings.</p>
<p>When I moved in, I was just starting a new career. I&rsquo;d just started dating someone new after a horrific breakup. And I&rsquo;d been living with less than ideal people - mostly randomers. It was a fresh start - exciting and liberating.</p>
<p>So yes, so what if our landlord was weird about us transferring away from British Gas? He insisted that it was ‘not British’ and ‘British things are better’. A watertight argument. He then ranted at my female flatmate for doing it, because, I dunno, women?</p>
<p>I was the one who changed the gas.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I could come home and chill out. And relax. And hang out with a friend. I&rsquo;m about to go on a preposterous three week holiday around Australia and the far east. The upcoming journey has made me pontificate about my home life. I&rsquo;m temporarily homeless, and it&rsquo;s the weirdest feeling. Yes, home is boring and safe, but it&rsquo;s also where we spend most of our time. It&rsquo;s somewhere we can be alone. It&rsquo;s worth appreciating it from time to time.</p>
<p>Of all the things I&rsquo;ll miss, the obvious is <a href="http://www.gokyuzurestaurant.co.uk/">Gokuyuzu</a>. Or maybe <a href="http://www.yasarhalim.com/">Yasir Halim</a>. Actually, it&rsquo;s got to be Buy2Save, on Turnpike Lane. I swear to God, I&rsquo;ll never love a local shop the way I love that Turkish shop.</p>
<p>I would prefer not to have a bathroom that’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWoWHzq21tA">parodied on Mitchell &amp; Webb</a>, though.</p>
