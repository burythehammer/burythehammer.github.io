		<p>I always used to write about music, but I stopped (reasons: complicated). I&rsquo;m going to write a bit here about what I liked this year, though. I&rsquo;m not pretending to be comprehensive. Or even that knowledgeable. But I know what I&rsquo;ve enjoyed.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="grimes---art-angels">Grimes - Art Angels</h2>
<p>Grimes has taken her quirky brand of experimental pop and made it mainstream. I literally cannot stop listening to it. It&rsquo;s catchy, it&rsquo;s quirky, it&rsquo;s danceable - pop at its very best. The kind of album I find myself dancing to, late at night, drunk. There are so many great songs on here, it&rsquo;s hard to know where to start. <em>Butterfly</em> and <em>Realiti</em> are my picks, but I could listen to any song. It&rsquo;s great. So great.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="joanna-gruesome---peanut-butter">Joanna Gruesome - Peanut Butter</h2>
<p>I once very drunkenly talked with one of Joanna Gruesome at Field Day a few years ago. I was probably a douche (I am a douche ordinarily, so alcohol probably didn&rsquo;t help). I also hadn&rsquo;t listened to them at all by that point, which is a shame for me, because they&rsquo;re fantastic. <em>Weird Sister</em> was a wonderful album, and this is just as good.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t remember who it was I bonded with that day, to my eternal shame.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="courtney-barnett---sometimes-i-sit-and-think-and-sometimes-i-just-sit">Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I sit and think, and sometimes I just sit.</h2>
<p>I went to Australia this year for the wedding of two of my favourite people. This is an album that got mentioned a lot by the two of them. I was assured that Courtney was a big thing there - and now, I see why. Exactly the kind of lyrical texture and down to earth themes that I like from Allo Darlin&rsquo;, except with a bitter, deadpan twist. There&rsquo;s incredible wit in those lyrics.</p>
<p>(as a side note, almost nobody there has heard of The Lucksmiths, so get your listening habits in order, Australia.)</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="new-order---music-complete">New Order - Music Complete</h2>
<p>I grew up with New Order, so you&rsquo;d think I was biased, and you&rsquo;re right. I thought this was going to be awful. Peter Hook (their star bassist) has left, their last couple of efforts have been very variable, so it was a massive surprise to me how good this album turned out. Gillian Gilbert - who has been absent since their reform in 2001 - is a silent credit here, and they&rsquo;re far better at doing electronic pop music than the guitary indie that Hook was driving the band towards. <em>Tutti Frutti</em> sounds cheesy at first, but has an amazingly catchy chorus, and <em>Restless</em> is every bit as endearing as <em>Regret</em>, at least to my ears.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="haiku-salut---etch-and-etch-deep">Haiku Salut - Etch and Etch Deep</h2>
<p>If there was ever such a thing as twee post rock, this would be it. If anything though, that label is selling them short. This is a wonderful, touching album. My only regret is that I didn&rsquo;t get into them sooner and saw more of their live stuff.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="kurt-vile---blieve-im-goin-down">Kurt Vile - B&rsquo;lieve I&rsquo;m Goin Down</h2>
<p>This is a good album. Okay, so it&rsquo;s not as good as <em>Wakin&rsquo; on a Pretty Daze</em>. Few things are. It&rsquo;s still a good album, if a little inconsistent. I don&rsquo;t think the dreamy hazy stuff works as well, but <em>Pretty Pimpin&rsquo;</em> is one of the best pop songs I&rsquo;ve heard from Kurt.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="cheatahs---mythologies">Cheatahs - Mythologies</h2>
<p>Who? What? I like Cheatahs a lot, they&rsquo;re not especially well known though. Shoegaze-y instrumental bollocks. Consistently great. If I was better at writing about music, I&rsquo;d be able to write more, but y&rsquo;know, deal with it.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="belle--sebastian---girls-in-peacetime-want-to-dance">Belle &amp; Sebastian - Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance</h2>
<p>Poor old Belle &amp; Sebastian, forever living in the shadow of the fact they&rsquo;ve written some of the best pop albums of all time. They still crank out great stuff though (if again, they&rsquo;re inconsistent). Nobody&rsquo;s Empire deserves to be recognised as one of their all time greats - tender, well paced, catchy, yet defiantly lacking a chorus.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="the-mountain-goats---beat-the-champ">The Mountain Goats - Beat the Champ</h2>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m compensating for not knowing enough about The Mountain Goats. They&rsquo;re a fun band but I never put the effort in. Beat The Champ has a belter right near the start: The Legend of Chavo Guerrero, a tale about his favourite Mexican wrestler when growing up. I feel like the album never quite lives up to the high this sets, but it&rsquo;s still a great listen.</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="jeffery-lewis--los-bolts---manhattan">Jeffery Lewis &amp; Los Bolts - Manhattan</h2>
<p>For too long, an artist I refused to get. I even saw half his set (with the Junkyard) at Indietracks and just didn&rsquo;t understand it. Something I find frustrating, as I try to abide by the philosophy that if I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;get&rsquo; something subjective, it&rsquo;s my fault. Still, this album is pretty great. Funny and incisive at times (Support Tours is basically a far more detailed and bitter Silver Dollars), totally absurd at others (why is The Pigeon so stereotypically Jewish?).</p>
