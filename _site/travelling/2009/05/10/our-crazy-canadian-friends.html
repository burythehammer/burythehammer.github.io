<p>I haven't updated since we've been in Canada, so it's high time I did. I'm falling behind a little, I updated the Chicago entry about three or four days after we left. Woops. Now I'm talking about Canada in general after having spent nearly a week here. I'm going to fiddle some of the dates to more accurately reflect when we were passing through the relevant areas (ooh, cheater!).<br &#47;>
<div><br &#47;>Canada is a bizarre experience though. I've been through here before when I was much younger, on the elder side of seventeen. I was about a year away from going to university, and was used to travelling, but not overnight, and not abroad. Toronto was my first experience of a big city, and Ottawa my first experience of a north american suburb. I now, on reflection, realise how watered down a version of the American experience I received.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I should note that, in general, the Canadians are more American than they like to think they are. A lot of their personal identity is sourced from European style influence without actually being particularly European. For example, I've seen a lot of English&#47;Irish style pubs since I've been in the country. If you go into them though, they are essentially American bars with different decor. Most of the activity still happens around the bar, and the staff will still serve you and expect tips like over the border. At home, I cannot think of a single pub where you will get served beer to your table. They will just look at you like you're insane. There is more: the cheapness of eating out, the kind of cars they buy, which sports are popular (although they are crazy about ice hockey here, baseball et cetera are still relatively popular).<br &#47;><br &#47;>This said, there are elements of influence creeping their roots in everywhere. If you do not come from Canada, these aren't from particularly obvious places. For a start, there's a massive Chinese population, particularly in the big cities (Toronto and Vancouver). There's a similar size population from India, and the rest of asia, as well, due to Canada's relatively lax immigration policy (one I would personally recommend, although anyone balking of space limitations ought to be slapped upside the face). This means there's a generally more multicultural and relaxed viewpoint towards the outside world: although, one could successfully argue, that it's the other way round (the reason there are more people is because there's a more relaxed viewpoint: but, whatever).<br &#47;><br &#47;>This, again, is a weird way of looking at it, and reflects the way we've done the trip. Toronto is the most American of the Canadian cities we're doing, Ottawa is somewhere in the middle, and Montreal is - well, it's something else.<br &#47;><&#47;div></p>
