<p>Yes yes, I've not updated in a while. My writing muscles have been fatigued from other things recently, and I haven't got the online time to update both.<br &#47;><br &#47;>(this is sort of a lie. I am basically lazy. It's a good thing I didn't become a journalist like I intended as a child)<br &#47;><br &#47;>Chicago, though. So far, it is my favourite place on our trip. There have been a variety of reasons, but largely because it is a city that has managed to constantly surprise me. It's also strangely homely, because it shares a lot of traits with London. The contrasts between rustic historical monuments and dazzlingly contemporary architecture is too familiar to bear. Unlike the rest of America, Chicago seems to understand that history should surround us. The Loop of the CTA* groans shudders on a regular basis above your head, like a creaky wooden roller coaster, as you skip in between art students who wear skinnier jeans than even me (okay, that's a lie, I've never met another guy who does that). At the same time, you're in a modern US city, with public modern art, city slickers, neck-destroyingly high sheets of glass that masquerade as buildings.<br &#47;><br &#47;>*[to explain: the CTA is the Chicago Transit, basically the train metro of the city. It's centred around an elevated loop of track around downtown, with rusted iron arches and wooden planks still holding it together - it shows its age. It's such an integral part of the city that they actually refer to the part of downtown encircled within it as The Loop]<br &#47;><br &#47;>It's also has a lot less of New York's cheesiness. New York is easily accessible for European tourists at the weekend, and it shows it - Chicago is a place outsiders, particularly foreigners, do not visit. Which is one of the reasons it has its charm, and one of the reasons we wanted to do this trip. We're basically immersing ourselves in the culture. A good <a href="http:&#47;&#47;jessamarsh.com&#47;">friend<&#47;a> of mine lives in Chicago, and we spent some time with her, going to bars, and even a local gig. Said gig reminds me of an East London art student gig so much, it makes me miss home.<br &#47;><br &#47;>No, Chicago was full of surprises for me. If you get to visit anywhere in the US, I would highly recommend it. It's not as immediately full of attractions as NYC, but the charm and atmosphere is entirely distinctive. And if I ever moved anywhere in the USA, it would be here.</p>
