<p>Okay, that's a joke. Ottawa is not a renegade city, but there was a Canadian Football team by that name several years ago. If you've ever been to Ottawa, you will know that, well, it's not exactly a place associated with renegades.<br &#47;><br &#47;>It is, in fact, one of the most genteel, civilised cities you're likely ever to visit. For your average British person coming to North America, you could not have an easier transition. It positively <em>oozes<&#47;em> British culture, and I can't quite describe why it is so. But, the skyscrapers are nowhere near as intimidating. Cycling and walking are not only possible, but a popular pasttime - and you will find it is the easiest way to get into the centre of town. Which, now I mention it, is stonkingly beautiful, and a joy to explore. The combination of greenery, low rise buildings, and the view across the Ottawa river, it's practically made to see at a slow pace. It is pretty much the opposite of a big city, and appears to have more in common with Durham than Toronto. There are street markets, victorian era buildings, and pubs that start to resemble home.<br &#47;><br &#47;>As said, we were staying with family (more precisely, my uncle David, aunt Fran, and our cousins Chris and Katy). This enabled us to get a bit of rest, save some money, and save our stomachs from fast food. However, this does not save us from our daily visits to Tim Hortons. I am clueless as to why there are none in the UK. Coffee is just over a dollar, donuts just under a dollar. We're talking Krispy Kreme style indulgence here. Two bucks for a coffee break, as opposed to approaching a fiver back home. God damn.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I also got my camera fixed. It cost a lot of money, but they did fix the circuit board (! which had apparently snapped), clean the lens and reset the lens cover (that has needed doing for a while). I'm a bit snap happy, and proceeded to take loads of photos of Ottawa the day it got fixed. Today I have taken over 200 photos. There's a lot of redundancy, I tend to take different angles, different zooms, different exposure and focal settings, and see which ones look best back on the computer. You could call it professionalism. I, however, prefer to call it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>(for the non-statistically literate, I should explain. The general idea is that the larger your sample size, the more it will resemble what you are sampling from. This idea extends quite nicely to photography, non?)<br &#47;><br &#47;>In Montreal at the moment, not sure I'll finish the entry for it tonight. We'll see. It's already our last day in Canada, and we've got a week left on our trip. It's all gone very, very quickly.</p>
