<div>We touched down in JFK just two days ago, but already there's too much to transcribe. The amount of contact time we've had with the internet has been patchy at best, so this is the first time I've really had to write an entry.<br &#47;><br &#47;>But I won't get it all.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Familiarising ourselves with the small differences has been one of the more remarkable aspects. Even though the UK and the USA are culturally similar - we do share a language - getting by isn't without its difficulties. We've been quickly absorbing bar culture (well, what can I say: we both enjoy a drink). Mark and I had a lengthy discussion about tipping, and we seem to have settled upon what to do. See, I assume it goes much like a restaurant back in the UK: you leave a tip directly after paying, and leave. In a bar though, you pay multiple times, so do you tip a small amount each drink you have, or leave a larger tip upon leaving? They don't seem to collect them until you leave the bar, so it appears to be the latter. I felt like a right tit sitting at the bar with a few dollar bills in front of me for about an hour (but I've seen regulars do it since, so it looks like you can do it either way. There are other things. America smells different - the food, the cleaning fluids, the pollution. We walked down an entire avenue smelling about 30 different things, one every few feet. I could go on.<br &#47;><br &#47;>New York itself is a wonderful town, and when I finally get my photos uploaded (may have to buy an extra lead) you'll see yourselves. We've seen the Statue of Liberty (it's pretty small and far away), walked the entire length of central park (my FEET HURT), seen the Hudson and walked the Brooklyn Bridge by sunset (taking a photo cheapens the experience), and spent an entire night talking to a stagehand on Broadway (he rated US cities by the quality of their strip joints).<br &#47;><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338909950834714226" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 240px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SheeUENNJnI&#47;AAAAAAAACmo&#47;5f_eHnuBwSg&#47;s320&#47;P1020220.JPG" border="0" &#47;><br &#47;>It's been sensory overload. I'm now exhausted, and will get some shut eye. We're picking the car up in the morning, and are going to drive to Philly.<&#47;div><&#47;div></p>
