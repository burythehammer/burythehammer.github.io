<div>Literally, and metaphorically.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Coming out of New York, with a lot less money than coming in (phew), the weather picked up. Well, picking up might be putting it a bit lightly, actually. The weather here is insanely good. The weather channel is calling it a heatwave. The guy also gave us a much better car than we paid for. And our hotel was great. It was pretty much blue skies ahead.<br &#47;><&#47;div><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338911258021707922" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 240px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 320px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;1.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;ShefgJ23wJI&#47;AAAAAAAACmw&#47;p20A300agWo&#47;s320&#47;P1020349.JPG" border="0" &#47;><br &#47;>Philidephia is a bizarre place. For the first half of the day, we spent it leisurely strolling around historic America. The liberty bell, the independence hall, Edgar Allan Poe's house. The roads were thick with tourists of all shapes and sizes (although usually American or chinese&#47;japanese). It felt like a small historic theme park, only a city. As the day wore on, we start to wonder about getting some food and a few drinks.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We'd been told, by a drunk guy in a bar in NYC, that there are only two places worth going in Philly. The historic district, and South Street. The latter is a more thriving affair, but to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect. The result is somewhat of a melding of Brighton, Brick Lane, and the Notting Hill Carnival. It's got the bohemia of the first two, the gay culture of brighton, the ethnic mix of the carnival, and a few little streaks of its own. There's a lot of random art decorating the buildings, and young student types in daring clothes roam the street. I chose a bar called the Tattoo'd Mom for some drinks, and the music instantly stunned me. Animal Collective, New Order, the Smiths, Yo La Tengo, this is the kind of stuff I'd expect in a decent alternative London venue. The choices on the jukebox (Okkervil River, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Selecter - out of like 8 albums) were even more stunning. They served vegan food and cheap local beers.<br &#47;><&#47;div>

Hardcore americana and fashionable liberal culture.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I've already done Washington DC, but brother is moaning and wants in on the computer. Another day. Maybe it wasn't a tale of two cities after all.</p>
