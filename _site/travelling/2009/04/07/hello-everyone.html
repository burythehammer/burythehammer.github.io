<div>If you've made it this far, well done. This is a blog written by a twenty something boy, about to embark on a trip around Northern America, armed only with a car, a limited supply of cash, and his brother.&nbsp;This is something I have wanted to do for a long time. I have more than a few friends in the country, I love travelling (but hate foreign languages), and find the United States probably one of the most fascinating places on Earth. We have the luxury of an entire five weeks to travel, but the pace will be brisk, and at times probably feel a little ruthless. Regardless, it promises to be a thoroughly exciting journey - one I cannot believe is a mere forteen days from this date.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Our scheduled trip is a circular route around the East Coast, swinging round the US to Chicago then taking the route back via Canada and Boston. Precise dates are fuzzy, but we'll wing it somehow.<&#47;div>

<div>See you round the bend.<&#47;div></p>
