<p>As I type this, I'm in Columbus, Ohio, yet to explore the city. Brother and I are going to go exploring some bars near the university later, but I'm going to take the opportunity here to make some miscellaneous observations.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Americans very much seem to have modes where they really want something, but lack it from that into their ordinary lives. They sort of have modes where they take something rather than incorporate it into their surroundings. Take an example: history. There are very heavily historical districts, but they like it to be cordoned off. Enjoyed for a day out, when they feel like it. Americans seem to complain they don't have much history, but it's just experienced in a different manner to Europe. We're surrounded by it back home, it's part of our everyday lives. Period houses are very desirable, and city centres tend to be a dolly mixture of the very old and the modern, cathedrals next to office blocks, and such. Another one is scenery. Go a few miles out of the suburbs or off the interstate, you'll find lush wilderness hardly found in the UK. Driving through the Appalachians reminded me of north wales. Not exactly the same, but the same feeling of awe, isolation, and natural beauty. Fitness is another: no pedestrians, only the larger cities have (some) cyclists. DC center had a lot of joggers and cyclists, but the vast majority of Americans who exercise seem to do it in climate controlled running factories. Which they drive to.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Another thing I've noticed, and been severely warned about by Bill <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Bryson<&#47;span>: pedestrianisation. It doesn't exist. You're some sort of massive weirdo if you walk any sort of distance outside of an inner city. We were walking from our hotel in Pittsburgh towards a bar, and it must have been just under a mile walk. Was there a sidewalk there? Was there hell. We walked down the side of the road, getting dirty shoes and being honked at by presumably bemused motorists. Most bars are far away and out the reach of public transport (which is shoddy at best). It doesn't surprise me why there's a problem with drink driving in the US, or that the drinking age is so high, or that there's less of a drinking culture here. How the hell are a group of people meant to go out for the night if you can't get to the bar and back? It defies explanation.<br &#47;><br &#47;>On the brighter side of US culture, the attitude towards business seems to be generally healthier here. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Entrepreneurial<&#47;span> spirit is high, service is better, competition seems to be better amongst most markets. Profit, in general, is not a dirty word, because they understand it means more jobs. They also seem to be more computer savvy, and do things more efficiently. Smaller businesses seem to do better, too, and I've seen lots of adverts for all kinds of things. Adverts are also a lot more informative in nature. When's the last time back home you saw an advert that was trying to tell you something? Rather than the European 'lifestyle' type adverts, more about associating their brand with a particular way of living. Beer adverts that are about making blokey jokes than the taste&#47;price, or mobile phone adverts which is more about making it look cool or sophisticated than actually talk about the features.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Also, the Americans know how to make a hearty meal. We went in Denny's earlier and I was fit to burst after only having spent about $8 (full breakfast platter plus a stack of pancakes), and it was damn tasty too. Although it will probably make me die of a heart attack if I eat that every morning. Inner fatness indeed.</p>
