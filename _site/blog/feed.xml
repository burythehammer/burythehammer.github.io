					<p>The password cracking minigame on Fallout is so annoying, I made a little script to help you do it.</p>

<p>It’s because I’ve been playing Fallout: New Vegas for the first time recently. Lots of my friends are playing Fallout 4, which I’m not all that excited by - but I thought I’d play New Vegas instead, because I really like Obsidian Entertainment. It may be mostly because one of their founders is Chris Avellone, who was the principal designer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape%3A_Torment">Planescape Torment</a>, one of my favourite games of all time.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ckL1M.jpg" alt="Image Alt" /></p>

<p>Anyway, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas both have this little minigame you have to do every time you want to ‘hack’ a terminal, because of course computers let anybody access root if you do a trivial little word game. It’s very annoying, not much fun, and way better done by a script. So I wrote one.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/burythehammer/fallout-password-checker">You can find it on Github here</a>, along with the instructions on how to use it.</p>

<p>I am sadly aware that it probably would have been quicker to use a pen and paper than spend an hour writing this.</p>

				<title>Testing With Microservices</title>
				
				<description>I’ve got some free, non-billable time at the moment at work, so they’ve let me do a bit of research and development, as well as some technical blog posts.

					<p>I’ve got some free, non-billable time at the moment at work, so they’ve let me do a bit of research and development, as well as some technical blog posts.</p>

<p>I can’t reproduce them here (they’re written on company time, so it’s fair enough they have it exclusively on their site), but it feels silly not to link over to any stuff I do.</p>

<p>For my first post, I’ve written about my work on the Sedex Advance project. I started pretty much as soon as I joined OpenCredo, and I was impressed by the technical wizardry they had employed. Some of the advanced architectural design we used impacted my work as a tester, so I’ve written up my reflections on what kind of difficulties we had, and the kind of techniques we used to combat them. It’s also, from a tester’s perspective, a good introduction to the architecture if you’ve not encountered it before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opencredo.com/2015/11/11/testing-with-microservices/">Testing with Microservices</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Microservices is a] great architectural style when implemented correctly. However, microservices bring inherent operational complexity, which you can’t ignore, and your testing strategy will have to reflect this.</p>

				<title>Reading List</title>
				
				<description>I read a lot. Here are the things I read.

					<p>I read a lot. Here are the things I read.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My main dose of current affairs. There’s almost never fluff pieces, and I find the weekly newsmagazine format suits my habits a lot more than a daily newspaper. Their science &amp; technology section is also genuinely excellent.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk/">Private Eye</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most people start reading Private Eye for the cartoons, and then realise they do some of the best investigative journalism in the UK. Rotten Boroughs and In The Back are full of important stuff that everyone should read.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/">Ars Technica</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The best of the bunch as far as tech websites go. Probably not nearly as developer based as I would like. Their UK site has been championing an anti-survelliance agenda at the moment, which I’m quite impressed by.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Rock Paper Shotgun</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Above all else, the best thing about RPS is that they treat videogames as a medium rather than a weird hobby. I trust their opinion on PC games more than anywhere else. Talk a lot about smaller, independent games.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/">GamaSutra</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Significantly more technical and usually cover the game creation process rather than reviewing the finished product. Their blog section is excellent.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://littlewhitelies.co.uk/">Little White Lies</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Often pretentious, but I have yet to find another site whose taste in films I share more. They review a lot of movies outside the mainstream I’d have never heard of otherwise.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.qwantz.com/">Dinosaur Comics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pretty sure I learned more from Dinosaur Comics when I was a student than I did from my actual physics course. Ryan North also writes the excellent Adventure Time comics series.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/">Daily Mash</a> / <a href="http://www.newsthump.com/">NewsThump</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where better to learn about what’s happening in the mainstream media than something that mocks it relentlessly?</p>

				<title>New Beginnings</title>
				
				<description>In a last ditch effort to attempt to be professional about something, I’ve relaunched this blog.

					<p>In a last ditch effort to attempt to be professional about something, I’ve relaunched this blog.</p>

<p>Originally this was a blog about music, specifically indiepop music, with a focus on gigs. With a bit of photography thrown in. My aims with this relaunch are somewhat more professionally oriented (I work in tech, but more on that later), but there’ll probably be plenty of personal stuff on here too.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen to move the tech stack of the blog to be something far cleaner and more lightweight. I’m no big fan of Wordpress, so I’ve decided to move to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> instead, hosted on the delightful <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. This has a number of advantages, but it’s mostly just super easy to maintain, is very customisable, and is extremely minimal. This is a personal blog, not an all singing, all dancing corporate website.</p>

<p>I’m also inspired by the wonderful <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Shit’s lightweight and loads fast</li>
    <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
    <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
    <li>The motherfucker’s accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
    <li>Shit’s legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All the old posts are backed up too, but I don’t expect anyone to read, or miss them. Me included.</p>
