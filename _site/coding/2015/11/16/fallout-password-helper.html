    <p>The password cracking minigame on Fallout is so annoying, I made a little script to help you do it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because I&#39;ve been playing Fallout: New Vegas for the first time recently. Lots of my friends are playing Fallout 4, which I&#39;m not all that excited by - but I thought I&#39;d play New Vegas instead, because I really like Obsidian Entertainment. It may be mostly because one of their founders is Chris Avellone, who was the principal designer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape%3A_Torment">Planescape Torment</a>, one of my favourite games of all time.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ckL1M.jpg" alt="Image Alt"></p>

<p>Anyway, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas both have this little minigame you have to do every time you want to &#39;hack&#39; a terminal, because of course computers let anybody access root if you do a trivial little word game. It&#39;s very annoying, not much fun, and way better done by a script. So I wrote one.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/burythehammer/fallout-password-checker">You can find it on Github here</a>, along with the instructions on how to use it.</p>

<p>I am sadly aware that it probably would have been quicker to use a pen and paper than spend an hour writing this.</p>
