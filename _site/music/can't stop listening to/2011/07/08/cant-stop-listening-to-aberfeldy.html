<p>There's a curious reason I can't stop listening to Aberfeldy.</p>
<p>Their band name starts with an A. Even worse, it's followed by a B. This pretty much means it's at the top of my&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;library, and I'm a sucker for suggestion.&nbsp;<em>Somewhere to Jump From<&#47;em>&nbsp;was probably one of my favourite releases last year. Combined with ALWAYS seeing it when I loaded my library, it's a must for plays.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong though, Aberfeldy do deserve it. They're unabashedly twee and folky, but squeeze in a lot of catchy synth riffs as well. Riley Briggs is an extremely skilled songwriter, the lyrics are clever and unusual - <em>If I were a Joiner <&#47;em>sings about using your natural talents to make dedications towards your lover. If singers sing about their lovers, what on earth would someone else do?</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were a joiner, you know what I'd do?<br />
I'd put up a shelf<br />
A shelf all about you<&#47;blockquote><br />
