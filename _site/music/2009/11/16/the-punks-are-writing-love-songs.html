<p>I really, really enjoy The Roadside Poppies.</p>

<div>I think I picked this one off a random Twee mixtape, but it comes from the wonderfully sad <em>Cycling &amp; Crying <&#47;em>EP, of which only maybe one-two hundred or so were made. A goddamn shame too.<&#47;div></p>
<div>I think <em>Just Another Love Song<&#47;em> has a particular appeal to me because it's self referential love song ABOUT love songs - a weakness of mine. It is no great surprise I am very fond of <em>69 Love Songs<&#47;em>, a monumentally satirical and yet epic tribute towards the love song (<em>The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure<&#47;em> is a delight, the grammatical piecing apart of what love even <strong>means<&#47;strong>). It's also surprising as my favourite bands when I was growing up had pretty terrible lyrics. Perhaps I just enjoy the idea of people taking the mick out of it - take a step outside the love song and you can critique it with good humour, particularly when you mention realistic things that love songs never mention.<&#47;div></p>
<div>"well, I'll pretend to like your taste in music, but please don't make me watch any soaps.."<&#47;div></p>
