<p>Sometime around this summer, I thought radio was dead (apart from the obviously superb <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bbc.co.uk&#47;6music&#47;shows&#47;adamandjoe&#47;">Adam &amp; Joe<&#47;a>, self admitted Black Squadron member here), and then I happened across <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bbc.co.uk&#47;6music&#47;shows&#47;marc_riley&#47;">Marc Riley<&#47;a>. It's rare to come across a DJ that so nicely fits the type of music I like to listen to, one that probes new music and also happens to cover a lot of bands I've <i>already seen and thought nobody ever had heard of<&#47;i>. The fact he used to be in The Fall helps. Slightly. He's had all kinds of people play sessions for him - Joan as Police Woman, Field Music, Strike the Colours..
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>I was neatly reminded of this tonight, when I realised that he had - and I don't kid - Help Stamp out Loneliness in session yesterday. Here's a video I RECORDED MYSELF at Basement Scam only a few weeks back.<&#47;div>

<div>This summer at Indietracks, they were a real standout for me, one of the bands that totally blew me away. It was made doubly surprising by the fact none of my twee friends had heard of them and the lead singer was wearing a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">horrific<&#47;span> dress. I mean I love weird dresses on girls, I really do, but that gold dress was too much.<&#47;div>

<div>Even reposting it feels <i>painful<&#47;i>.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Help Stamp Out Loneliness are nothing short of <span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">superb<&#47;span> though. Soulfully deep vocals with bloopy janglepop (the band claims there's some krautrock there too, I can't hear it). The fact they haven't got anything on CD or ANY format other than vinyl is incredibly frustrating for a genuine fan. I pleaded with them at Basement Scam's CD stall but they weren't having of it. Roll on the eventual album, they've got enough bloody songs out.<&#47;div></p>
