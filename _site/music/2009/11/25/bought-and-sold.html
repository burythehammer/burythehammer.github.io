<div>I think the thing that always surprised me about Pocketbooks is that they manage to be really fucking good without having anything distinguishable about them. Once I confronted the two above at Twee as Fuck myself and stated this - they laughed and agreed. I first saw them at Offset last year, where they were quite excellent, but they've come from strength to strength since. Having sat down and listened to <i>Flight Paths<&#47;i>, their d&eacute;but album, I'm not that much closer to the mystery. Their lyrics are exceptional (and occasionally very funny), detailing the minutiae of London life better than any other band. I mean, come on, "I was late, I was tired, I lost my oyster card"? The heart of it is the music though, and they're the archetypal indiepop band. Everything you expect: jangly guitars, angelically high male vocals, female vocals that sound like a 60s pop record, delicate plinky plonks on the keyboard (set to 'piano' mode). It all seems to greater than the sum of its parts however, as the songwriting is simply exceptional.<&#47;div>

<div>These pictures, if you are heartily wondering, were taken at Indietracks. There was an excellent lineup on the hangar stage that day, including the <i>other<&#47;i> band that I've received an album by, Butcher Boy (also on How Does It Feel to be Loved).<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>I have less detailed info on Butcher Boy, but I am really enjoying their album, which is probably more consistent than Pocketbooks (but they are also an older band). The vocals have a really unique draw to them, and the music feels really morose and soulful, yet delightfully upbeat when it wants to. It sounds like a bizarre link to make, but imagine if Dexys Midnight Runners tried to do some Morrissey covers. Not a <i>million<&#47;i> miles off but not entirely the full story.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>They have the entire new album up on their <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.myspace.com&#47;butcherboymusic">Myspace<&#47;a>, which is definitely worth checking out, <i>Carve a Pattern<&#47;i> is a really great single.<&#47;div></p>
