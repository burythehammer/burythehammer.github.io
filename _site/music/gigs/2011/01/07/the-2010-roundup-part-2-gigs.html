<p>Here's something I actually forget to post. Whoops.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think it was one of the better years of recent memory for music: especially indiepop, which saw a lot of fantastic releases - Shrag, Wild Nothing, Belle &amp; Sebastian, I could go on. Sadly, nothing from the Pains of Being Pure at Heart. Alas, you cannot have everything. Here's three gigs that manage not to mention Indietracks at all.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Wild Nothing (Upset the Rhythm @ Cargo, 11th November)<&#47;strong><strong> <&#47;strong><&#47;h4></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> <&#47;strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">I ended up going to this show after finding out about it on Facebook literally 8 hours before it happened. Thankfully, there were tickets on the door, and I ended up convincing a female to go with me. As poor company as I probably was, it made&nbsp;up for it by an absolute barnstorm of gorgeous, dreamy feedback. Wild Nothing's album <&#47;span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Gemini<&#47;em><&#47;span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> has been one of my favourite all year, and I was really looking forward to seeing them. Little did I expect it would be as good as it was here though - they managed to surpass even&nbsp;their album. There's something about shoegaze that just sounds better live. These are some of the best guys around for modern dream pop.<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<h4><strong>2. The Wedding Present (KoKo, 13th December)<&#47;strong><&#47;h4></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I didn't bring my camera to this one. My bad. The Wedding Present are pretty much one of&nbsp;<em>the<&#47;em> British alternative guitar bands from the 1980s, alongside The Smiths, New Order, and The&nbsp;Fall. In fact, after the demise of The Smiths, they were pretty much the most popular indie-rock band around. All this makes it even more shocking that <em>nobody my age has heard of them.<&#47;em> I'm in my 20s, but it seems the average age of a Wedding Present fan is about 30-40 something. Contrary to Wild Nothing though, where everyone stood still appreciatively, The Wedding Present's show was raucous, thrashing and lively. Yes, most of the fans are approaching 40. They seem&nbsp;in pretty good shape though, because by god did they move - 'Take Me!' is an exhausting 9 minutes long, and&nbsp;burly, sweaty, hairy men crushed me, still dancing and moshing by the end of it. I could barely breathe. This isn't even taking into account the absolutely fantastic rendition of <em>Brassneck <&#47;em>that got almost literally the entire venue pumping. These guys have tremendous energy. They also don't do any encores - they just play an extra two songs.<&#47;p><br />
<strong>1. The Pains of Being Pure at Heart (Basement Scam @ Buffalo Bar, 30th July)<&#47;strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is probably not even the best gig I've been to in 2010, most likely one of the best I will ever get the chance to go to in my life. I am an unabashed Pains fan, but on occasion their live shows are disappointing - a sad result of being a 'hipster' band. We all know how uncool it is to enjoy yourself, so when the Pains play their larger gigs, absolutely everyone looks completely miserable. This was something different, however - after having headlined <em>Indietracks 2010<&#47;em> (pretty damn good) and playing Heaven (disappointing), they play at Basement Scam under the moniker 'George Washington's Penis'. Basement Scam is a fun affair anyway, a labour of love run by Sean from Fortuna Pop, and mainly showcasing Fortuna Pop bands and their ilk. I was informed of the gig through <em>top&nbsp;secret sources<&#47;em> and invited some of my good friends to come along. The Buffalo Bar is pretty much one of the smallest venues in London, and comprises mainly of a bar and a tiny room which can fit 100 people at an absolute&nbsp;<strong>maximum<&#47;strong>. All of these people on this night were either friends of the band, friends of the record label, regulars, or in a band in the indiepop scene themselves. Every one of them was a massive Pains fan, so you can imagine that the entire place was pumping. I saw crowd surfing<em>.<&#47;em> I was sweating out of my eyeballs. I was dancing next to people from Pocketbooks, Allo Darlin, you name it. I could touch Kip. I got smashed on the head with a bottle accidentally and almost got&nbsp;a concussion. But you know what? <em>Totally god damn worth it<&#47;em>.<&#47;p></p>
