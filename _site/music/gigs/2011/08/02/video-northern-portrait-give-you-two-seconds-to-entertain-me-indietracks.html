<p>We are back in business, baby. I'm feeling considerably ill, and the post-indietracks blues are setting in. However, I have plenty of <em>excellent <&#47;em>photos (after borrowing a very nice camera) and some videos of special moments throughout the festival.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;IMG_3696.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" title="Northern Portrait" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;IMG_3696.jpg" alt="Northern Portrait" width="717" height="478" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;p><br />
The first special moment is an impromptu gig organised by Scared to Dance in the merchandise&nbsp;tent, by the lead singer of <strong>Northern Portrait,&nbsp;<&#47;strong>Stefan Larsen. I missed Northern Portrait two years ago, and only picked up on them because of the phenomenal song <em>In an Empty&nbsp;Hotel<&#47;em>&nbsp;on the Indietracks 2009 compilation. No awards for anyone to guess their greatest influence (The Smiths), but their songwriting and talent are&nbsp;unbelievable, with some inspired songs that give a new twist on an old formula. It's far superior to modern Morrissey (who is extremely variable and more than a little annoying), and it'd be difficult to find a Smiths fan that wouldn't enjoy this jangle filled, crooning gorgeousness.</p>
<p>Even more surprisingly, it translates extremely well to an acoustic level.&nbsp;The singing is powerful and emotional, and there's just enough jangle to echo the original. Below is a video I caught of their song <em>I Give You Two Seconds to Entertain Me, <&#47;em>a quieter song about being unimpressed with&nbsp;a seemingly perfect girl.</p>
