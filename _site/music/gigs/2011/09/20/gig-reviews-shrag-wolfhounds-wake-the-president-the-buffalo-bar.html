<p>I'm back! Uneventfully. After a two-week holiday on the East coast of the US (and some fun with hurricanes, floods and earthquakes), I'm back to actually writing something about indiepop. Here's a review I should have written a week ago.</p>
<p>It's a while since I've been to the Buffalo Bar, you understand. I've found myself skulking around the area a few times to other venues, but a really good concert here has eluded me for a few months. Twee as Fuck is long dead, Silver Rocket is long deceased (although has recently resurfaced), Basement Scam went with a bang, Baby Honey with a whimper. So many great band nights, such a great venue, some wonderful memories.&nbsp;Most of the time I've&nbsp;visited&nbsp;recently, it's for the excellent <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.howdoesitfeel.co.uk&#47;">HDIF<&#47;a> spin-off <em>Great Big Kiss<&#47;em>, a 60s&#47;Northern Soul based night, but it seems that it's&nbsp;all clubs these days. Fortunately,&nbsp;Guided Missile still exists, but I scarcely recognise a lot of bands that play there. Until I saw this eye-popping line-up - holy cow, that's one, no two, no <em>three<&#47;em>&nbsp;indie-pop&nbsp;bands! <em>Good<&#47;em>&nbsp;indie-pop&nbsp;bands! I can barely stop pressing my hyphen key.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF4899.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" title="Wake the President" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF4899.jpg" alt="Wake the President" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I could scarcely believe it when I saw <strong>Wake the President<&#47;strong>&nbsp;on the line-up. I had no time to realise that <em>You Can't Change that Boy<&#47;em>&nbsp;was a stone-cold indiepop classic before they'd stopped touring - the last time I saw them live was two years ago, at Indietracks 2009. Suddenly, they've appeared out of the void (Glasgow, actually) with a new album, although supporting two other bands. A shame, considering the quality of their work. Also, a shame considering the quality of the sound: It was just flat. Wake The President have a very distinctive sound, but you couldn't hear it at this gig. Songs like <em>Mail, Alice<&#47;em>&nbsp;have unique&nbsp;drums for indiepop, and their use of bouncy bass is a blast of fresh air in a scene traditionally obsessed with dreamy shoegaze treble. It's a shame, and not one I've not noticed with Guided Missile, the Buffalo Bar, nor Wake the President before. Shrug.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some of their new stuff sounds really promising, although it doesn't sound like it matches up to their previous efforts. I particularly liked <em>Elaine<&#47;em>&nbsp;and <em>This is New<&#47;em>, enough to ask the lovely merch guy whether he had a copy of any new stuff on CD. It took asking their label owner to get a copy of <em>Zumutung!<&#47;em>, which I will currently digesting and will give my thoughts on later.</p>

<p>Sadly, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about <strong>The Wolfhounds<&#47;strong>. I think I remember at one point saying I'd stop seeing C86 bands for fear of disappointment, but it seems I just <em>can't avoid them<&#47;em>. I wasn't sure I was going to recognise anything - I really couldn't recall which song of theirs was on the C86 - but when <em>Anti-Midas Touch<&#47;em>&nbsp;came on, I was vaguely relieved (it was on CD86, but let's not quibble small points..). I'd have to say it was my only highlight, but it proved to be a fairly enjoyable set. They have a lot of spunk (still!) and some fun songs. However, they're overshadowed by the next lot..</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF4921.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-466" title="Shrag" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF4921.jpg" alt="Shrag" width="1049" height="821" &#47;><&#47;a><strong>Shrag<&#47;strong>&nbsp;have been around the London indiepop scene for longer than I can remember. It's like they've always been here. Straddling the line between indiepop, post punk, and riot grrl, they make tight, growling songs that are bursting with energy. In fact, they, the band are pretty much bursting with energy. The lead singer has a distinctly crazy dance, and a surprisingly loud voice when she wants to show it.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, they seemed to be missing something that night. Shrag are a <em>great<&#47;em>&nbsp;band, don't get me wrong. The atmosphere was all wrong, though. The band didn't seem to have as much energy, and the sound (as I complained for the first band) was flat. It works well for bands with a dreamy sound, but here it just did not suit. Punchy, poppy songs - ones that Shrag and Wake the President thrive on - fall down. It's a shame, because they're all great bands: in fact, it's a great line up. It's a great venue. Guided Missile are usually great, too. I went away feeling strangely disappointed, though, and it's a real shame.</p>
