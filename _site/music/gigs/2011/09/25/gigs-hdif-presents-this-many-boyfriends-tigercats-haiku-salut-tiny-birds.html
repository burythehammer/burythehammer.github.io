<p>It's difficult to navigate the London indiepop scene without encountering How Does it Feel at least once, so here goes.</p>
<p>I feel slightly ashamed I've not been to one of the HDIF presents gigs before, but you see, well, they're usually down at Brixton Jamm. Living the other side of London makes things awkward, and I'm a lazy bum - especially on a school night. Still though, it's <em>free<&#47;em>&nbsp;(the best price) and this line-up really was something special.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5191.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-490" title="Tiny Birds" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5191.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Already playing by the time I arrived were <strong>Tiny Birds, <&#47;strong>a new band on my radar. They use a ukulele and a banjo as well as guitars and drums. The comical inclusion of a banjo probably tells you how serious this band are - they're poppy, jaunty, and casually joke between their songs, which masks how sad some of their lyrics are. They're one to look out for - they're languishing in obscurity, but given time I hope they can become something bigger, because their live shows are good, and so is their recorded material.&nbsp;You can get digital versions of their music for free from their&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tinybirds.co.uk">bandcamp<&#47;a>.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5218.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-491" title="Haiku Salut" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5218.jpg" alt="Haiku Salut" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p><strong>Haiku Salut<&#47;strong>&nbsp;are a band that's been making waves among my friends since their recent appearance at Indietracks (where I missed them). I was expecting 'another twee band', but I was wrong. Oh man, I was so wrong I can't express. They're an experimental orchestra made of loop pedals, accordions, melodicas, and god knows what else. It feels like watching Mary Poppins pull another instrument out of a never-ending bag. The three girls in the band remain mostly mute during the show, aside from the&nbsp;occasional&nbsp;mumbled thanks - it seems more out of humility than shyness, preferring to let the music speak. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;haikusalut.com&#47;">Their website<&#47;a> is also rather amusing, I can't stop sniggering at "Haik-uality Pictures".</p>
<p><strong>A Little Orchestra<&#47;strong>&nbsp;accompanied them for the last three songs.&nbsp;I worried that it would be tacked on, but it works wonderfully.&nbsp;Haiku Salut already tinker with a variety of unusual instruments, so adding&nbsp;traditional instruments perfectly complemented the music. They're a band I've not discussed at length yet, but who were fantastic at Indietracks and seem to&nbsp;permeate the indiepop landscape wherever they go - appearing with Pocketbooks and having a stellar lineup of guest singers with them at Indietracks.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5230.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-499" title="Tigercats" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF5230.jpg" alt="Tigercats" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a><strong>Tigercats<&#47;strong>&nbsp;are a band that are clearly destined to become much bigger.They enjoyed the most visual support of any of the bands, who seemed completely unknown just several months ago.&nbsp;When I saw them support Allo Darlin' in July, I turned to my friends, jaw slightly agape, hand limply pointing, with a confused look. Their straightforward guitar pop perfects the art of tight, compact melodies, with an almost surf rock tinge. Maybe I just say the surf rock thing because every time I see the lead singer, he's got a corny blue Hawaiian shirt on. That sums them up perfectly though, because they're casual, fun, and probably don't give a crap what I say about them. Well, at least the guy in the&nbsp;Hawaiian&nbsp;shirt. It's pretty awesome.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;this-many-boyfriends.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500" title="This Many Boyfriends" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;this-many-boyfriends.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a>Although he was saying it jokingly, I probably agree with the lead singer of <strong>This Many Boyfriends<&#47;strong>&nbsp;when he questioned why they were the headliners. I say it more because of how great Tigercats were, and how much the crowd reacted to them - not because This Many Boyfriends are bad in any way. In fact, they're great. Like a modern&nbsp;version of The Pooh Sticks, they're not so much an indiepop band, so much as a pastiche. Observers from the outside, they create ridiculous, shambling songs with&nbsp;in-jokes&nbsp;only an indiepop geek would get - "I don't like you, because you don't like the Pastels" embodies them perfectly in a chorus. They might not have the innate musical talent of those they mock or reference, but they more than make up for it with buckets of charm and an&nbsp;earnestness&nbsp;that's hard to criticise.</p>
<p><em>EDIT: Tragic news has come through that Peter Sykes, guitarist for This Many Boyfriends, has passed away due to a severe brain&nbsp;haemorrhage, under a week after this performance. Whereas I cannot say I knew him personally, with the community feel of the&nbsp;indie-pop&nbsp;scene, this affects us all. The band have left a personal message on their record company's website which you can read here:&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.arc018.com&#47;index.php">http:&#47;&#47;www.arc018.com&#47;index.php<&#47;a><&#47;em></p>
