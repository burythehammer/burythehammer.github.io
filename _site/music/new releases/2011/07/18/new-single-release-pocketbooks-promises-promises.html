Ah, it's nice to look back, isn't it? Pocketbooks, London's most understated indiepop band, have released a new single. The thing about Pocketbooks is that they prove that indiepop has a&nbsp;check list. Tick enough boxes and you'll get into the genre. Female vocals? Cool. Dress like the sixties? Sure. Act like the complete opposite of a rock star? Definitely. Pocketbooks are like a template for these qualities - they don't really have anything unique about them. You'd think this&nbsp;would make&nbsp;them generic, but the band has a genuinely great catalogue of songs.</p>
<p>This new song, then. It's called <em>Promises, Promises<&#47;em>, and it sounds a lot like it could have been their first album, <em>Flight Paths<&#47;em>. Except it has <strong>strings<&#47;strong>! Specifically, violins! The band doesn't have violin players, they're on loan from A Little Orchestra - a project led by Monster Bobby, mastermind behind The Pipettes. They somewhat dominate the track, along with Emma's vocals. The two work well together as the primary focus of the song, the rest of the band&nbsp;inconspicuously doing their thing.</p>
<p>The song is typical Pocketbooks, which is a massive relief: recent gigs have hinted that they might take a new direction. More prominent keyboards in some new songs almost sound lounge jazz-esque, with no remarkable features or hooks, just a bland mushy <em>blah<&#47;em>&nbsp;of music. These are all new though, and I have no idea whether they'll appear on the album. I hope not. More stuff like this one, guys.</p>
<p>You can download the track for free (yes, free!)&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;pocketbooks.bandcamp.com&#47;">here<&#47;a>, and a stream is available below.</p>
