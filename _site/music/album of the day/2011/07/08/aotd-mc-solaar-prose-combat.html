<p>First thing's first, MC Solaar is a French rap artist. And probably the most famous one. Yes - I know - French rap. It's not just a target for novel ridicule this time around, though. Solaar manages to surpass the silliness that say, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=UOHvTmQfXxk">Saian Supa Crew<&#47;a>&nbsp;have (they always seemed a bit ridiculous to me, anyway). The French language definitely has an advantage over English for a format that absolutely requires good flow - it just sounds <em>great<&#47;em>, and this album feels distinctly smoother than comparative albums in English. The compromise is that French has a considerably lower vocabulary, meaning rhymes are less flexible. Makes no difference to me though. I can't understand a god damn thing he's saying.</p>
<p>The entire album has a rather urban, jazzy feel to it. Solaar is not afraid to acknowledge his influences either - jazz samples abound, with echoes of trumpets, saxophones, and even a Serge Gainsbourg backing for the star track, Nouveau Western. This is a&nbsp;unique album, and definitely deserves a listen - rap fan or not. Oh, and Jools Holland is a huge fan. Weird.</p>
<p>Picks for this album are Nouveau Western and&nbsp;Obsol&eacute;te.</p>
