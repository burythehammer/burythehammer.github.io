<p>How long has it been since I've updated?</p>
<div>The answer, unsurprisingly, is "too long". A further dedication to work (that means less nights out boozing, gigging, etc) means my exposure to new music has been sadly lacking. I don't think I've bought into any new bands in the past month, which is a frankly depressing state of affairs. The only time I've been out is one AMS meeting and Baby Honey (the newest Twee as Fuck iteration, a delicious friday night slice of twee&#47;indie-pop). Oh shit, and there was Guided Missile's 10th anniversary too.<&#47;div></p>
<div>But yeah, three nights, one of which wasn't even a gig? I'm ashamed in myself. The Durutti Column played live last night, but Sunday nights I always feel very stressed out, due to work the next day, and it wasn't a luxury I could afford (timewise, at least. Money, with a salary, has become a non-issue).<&#47;div></p>
<div>When I turned up at the AMS night last Thursday I noticed that I hadn't done a mix CD for this year. I could just burn my 2009 mix, but that feels lazy, plus I made that over THREE (!) months ago. CRAZY! Like I listen to the same stuff I did three months ago!<&#47;div></p>
<div>The songs I've picked so far are..<&#47;div></p>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br />
<&#47;span><&#47;div><br />
<strong>La Casa Azul<&#47;strong> - Chicos Malos (imagine if Abba were Spanish and tripping balls)</p>
<p><strong>Heavenly<&#47;strong> - Sort of Mine (do I have a crush on Amelia Fletcher? WHO DOESN'T?)</p>
<p><strong>Bad Dream Fancy Dress<&#47;strong> - Rave-up (RAVE UP! WE JUST WANNA RAVE UP! WE JUST WANNA STAY UP!)</p>
<p><strong>Cicada<&#47;strong> - The Things You Say [dirty south remix] (who says I don't do heavy trance? This is some of the best shit around)</p>
<p><strong>Ferry Corsten<&#47;strong> - We Belong (this is the kind of populist electro the AMS usually overlook, but it's a fucking great track)</p>
<p><strong>Eggstone<&#47;strong> - April and May (I don't know much about Eggstone, but this is lovely laid back, strumtastic European indiepop)</p>
<p><strong>James Dean Driving Experience<&#47;strong> - Sean Connery (that fucking riff man, how can anyone not compare this to the among the best the Smiths ever did?)</p>
<p><strong>DJ Format [featuring Akil and Chali 2na]<&#47;strong> - We Know Something You Don't Know (DJ format is awesome, Akil and Chali 2na are from Jurassic 5, my favourite rap group ever. There is little that can go wrong here)</p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Fields<&#47;strong> - The Saddest Story Ever Told (The Magnetic Fields have just released their latest album, so here is a good opportunity to think: hey, aren't they one of the greatest bands ever?)</p>
<p><strong>The Attery Squash<&#47;strong> - Charlie Brooker is Right About Everything (well, he is)</p>
<p><strong>The Fall<&#47;strong> - The Classical (one of the best songs by one of the best bands ever. Absolutely classic track)</p>
<p><strong>Help Stamp Out Loneliness<&#47;strong> - Record Shop (the most beautifully emotional song I've heard in a LONG TIME)</p>
<p><strong>Roadside Poppies<&#47;strong> - Just Another Love Song (you already know my feelings about the Roadside Poppies. Beautiful, twee, sparkling and always upbeat, they have an honesty that makes my heart aflutter)</p>
<p><strong>Okkervil River<&#47;strong> - Our Life is Not a Movie or Maybe (why don't more people rave on about Okkervil River? Their contemporaries have become international superstars, but they outshine all of them. There's emotion contained here with such a genuine approach it seems criminal to overlook them)</p>
