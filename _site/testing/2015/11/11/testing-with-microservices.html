    <p>I&#39;ve got some free, non-billable time at the moment at work, so they&#39;ve let me do a bit of research and development, as well as some technical blog posts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t reproduce them here (they&#39;re written on company time, so it&#39;s fair enough they have it exclusively on their site), but it feels silly not to link over to any stuff I do.</p>

<p>For my first post, I&#39;ve written about my work on the Sedex Advance project. I started pretty much as soon as I joined OpenCredo, and I was impressed by the technical wizardry they had employed. Some of the advanced architectural design we used impacted my work as a tester, so I&#39;ve written up my reflections on what kind of difficulties we had, and the kind of techniques we used to combat them. It&#39;s also, from a tester&#39;s perspective, a good introduction to the architecture if you&#39;ve not encountered it before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Microservices is a] great architectural style when implemented correctly. However, microservices bring inherent operational complexity, which you canâ€™t ignore, and your testing strategy will have to reflect this.</p>
