<p>Hello, hello.&nbsp;Just a quick update to tell y'all what's happening around these parts. I haven't been blogging, but I sure have been busy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com&#47;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-565" title="hammer front page" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;hammer-front-page1.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="597" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;p><br />
First off, if you've not seen the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com">new front page<&#47;a>, I suggest you take a look! It's been made <em>by these very hands<&#47;em>. Although I started this website primarily for blogging, it's really a general purpose website for my stuff - so you can see some art I've done, the crappy little coding projects, and even view an<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com&#47;about"> extremely&nbsp;narcissistic&nbsp;page <&#47;a>about&nbsp;yours truly. Implying, of course, the entire website isn't an exercise in narcissism as it is.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;gallery-preview.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-566" title="gallery preview" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;04&#47;gallery-preview-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I also have a small <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com&#47;art&#47;gallery.php">gallery page<&#47;a> I've been working on to show off my gig photography. The aim is for the art section to turn into an all-purpose gallery. I enjoy taking photos but only use a small choice of the best to actually embed in reviews - for shame! If you're wondering how I did it (I know - you're most certainly not), I <em>made it myself<&#47;em>&nbsp;in php. Yeah, yeah,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Reinventing_the_wheel">reinventing the wheel<&#47;a>. Truth is though, most website gallery software is bloated and doesn't allow me to display it in a fashion consistent with the rest of the website. So <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=eJL1APHzyCw">nyah<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Oh, <em>and<&#47;em>, if you're a band&#47;label and you like my photography, I'm more than happy to give you hi-res versions if you get in contact (check the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com&#47;about">about section<&#47;a>). No charge - think of it as giving a bit back!</p>
<p>In future - I'd like to tackle the design of the this&nbsp;WordPress blog, but this is something I'll reserve for when I have time. In the meantime, priorities for me include catch-up reviews for some great albums, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MJ Hibbett<&#47;strong>'s (sort-of) new release&nbsp;<em><a href="http:&#47;&#47;mjhibbett.co.uk&#47;dinosaurplanet&#47;">Dinosaur Planet<&#47;a><&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li>That superb<strong> Standard Fare<&#47;strong>&nbsp;sophomore effort&nbsp;<em><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.co.uk&#47;Out-Of-Sight-Town&#47;dp&#47;B005SR0XUM">Out of Sight, Out of Town<&#47;a><&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li>Almost certainly d&eacute;but of the year, <strong>Tigercats<&#47;strong>&nbsp;stunning&nbsp;<em><a href="http:&#47;&#47;tigercatsband.com&#47;">Isle of Dogs<&#47;a><&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li>And possibly the greatest album of the lot, one I really shouldn't have a copy of but have a review waiting anyway...<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's a secret<&#47;span><&#47;strong>!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Meanwhile chaps, I have a lot on my plate, as I have impending exams - and a report to write by Monday! I leave you with a song - and the title of a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sweepingthenation.blogspot.co.uk&#47;">vastly superior rival<&#47;a> - that pretty much sums up why I love indiepop, and by connection<em>, all of you guys<&#47;em>.</p>
<p>Until next crime.</p>
