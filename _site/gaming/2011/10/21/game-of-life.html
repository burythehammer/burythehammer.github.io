<p>Since technically this is a gaming blog as well as a music blog (I almost never post about gaming, though), I thought I'd share one of my own creations with the world - a Java version of Conway's "Game of Life".</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;t.co&#47;aKcVcFDI">HERE<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>You'll need Java to run it, but most people have a version (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.java.com&#47;en&#47;download&#47;index.jsp">grab it here<&#47;a>). Just press each button to set the starting squares and hit space to start the game. Press space again to end it.</p>
<p>The rules are relatively simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>a space gives birth to a cell next turn if it surrounded by 3 other cells.<&#47;li>
<li>a cell dies next turn if surrounded by less than 2 cells (freezes) or more than 3 (overcrowding)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<div>There are some pretty fun patterns to be&nbsp;made, and I find it&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;hypnotizing&nbsp;to watch it grow and fluctuate! The<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Conway's_Game_of_Life">&nbsp;Wikipedia article<&#47;a> has some details about the mathematics, history, and interesting patterns (including ones that spawn and self-replicate).<&#47;div></p>
