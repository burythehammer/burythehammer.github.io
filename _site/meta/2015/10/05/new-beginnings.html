    <p>In a last ditch effort to attempt to be professional about something, I&#39;ve relaunched this blog.</p>

<p>Originally this was a blog about music, specifically indiepop music, with a focus on gigs. With a bit of photography thrown in. My aims with this relaunch are somewhat more professionally oriented (I work in tech, but more on that later), but there&#39;ll probably be plenty of personal stuff on here too.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve chosen to move the tech stack of the blog to be something far cleaner and more lightweight. I&#39;m no big fan of Wordpress, so I&#39;ve decided to move to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> instead, hosted on the delightful <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. This has a number of advantages, but it&#39;s mostly just super easy to maintain, is very customisable, and is extremely minimal. This is a personal blog, not a all singing, all dancing corporate website.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also inspired by the wonderful <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">Motherfucking website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shit&#39;s lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
<li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
<li>The motherfucker&#39;s accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li>Shit&#39;s legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>All the old posts are backed up too, but I don&#39;t expect anyone to read, or miss it. Me included.</p>
