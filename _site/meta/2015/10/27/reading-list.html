    <p>Back in the day, we&#39;d have called this a blogroll.</p>

<p>I read a lot. Here are the things I read.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Economist
My main dose of current affairs. There&#39;s almost never fluff pieces, and I find the weekly newsmagazine format suits my habits a lot more than a daily newspaper. Their science and technology section is also genuinely excellent.</p></li>
<li><p>Private Eye
Most people start reading Private Eye for the cartoons, and then realise they do some of the best investigative journalism in the UK. Rotten Boroughs and In The Back are full of important stuff that everyone should read.</p></li>
<li><p>Ars Technica
The best of the bunch as far as tech websites go. Probably not nearly as developer based as I would like. Videogame section is very populist, so I tend to steer away from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Rock Paper Shotgun
Above all else, the best thing about RPS is that they treat videogames as a medium rather than a weird hobby. I trust their opinion on PC games more than anywhere else. They&#39;re not always right, but they&#39;re always worth listening to.</p></li>
<li><p>GamaSutra
Significantly more technical and usually about the game creation process rather than reviewing the finished product. Their blog section is excellent.</p></li>
<li><p>Little White Lies
They&#39;ve got their head up their arse a lot of the time, but my taste in films coincides pretty well with them. They also mostly review films I&#39;d have never heard of otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Dinosaur Comics
I&#39;m pretty sure I learned more from Dinosaur Comics when I was a student than I did from my actual physics course.</p></li>
