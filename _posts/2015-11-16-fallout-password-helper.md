The password cracking minigame on Fallout is so annoying, I made a little script to help you do it.

It's because I've been playing Fallout: New Vegas for the first time recently. Lots of my friends are playing Fallout 4, which I'm not all that excited by - but I thought I'd play New Vegas instead, because I really like Obsidian Entertainment. It may be mostly because one of their founders is Chris Avellone, who was the principal designer of [Planescape Torment]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape%3A_Torment), one of my favourite games of all time.

Anyway, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas both have this little minigame you have to do every time you want to 'hack' a terminal, because of course computers let anybody access root if you do a trivial little word game. It's very annoying, not much fun, and way better done by a script. So I wrote one.

[You can find it on Github here](https://github.com/burythehammer/fallout-password-checker), along with the instructions on how to use it.

I am sadly aware that it probably would have been quicker to use a pen and paper than spend an hour writing this.
