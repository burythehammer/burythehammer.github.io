I am a twenty something nerd. This is my personal website, and it is named after a pretty great [Beat Happening song](https://youtu.be/NTZ7duah7aM). I've taken the unusual decision to write my profile in the first person, and it's pretty jarring, isn't it?

What I Do
---------

I work as a QA/Developer-in-test at [OpenCredo](https://www.opencredo.com/), an open-source software consultancy, and you can read a more professional work profile [over here](https://www.opencredo.com/company/people/matthew-long/). If I was really pressed to describe what I do (say, on a quiz show, with Alexander Armstrong hoping I say "musician" or "astronaut" or something else fun), I would probably just say software developer - but I'm a specialist in testing. If you're interested in hiring me, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burythehammer) is the place. Go nuts.

Interests
---------

In my spare time, I try to studiously avoid being a massive hipster, but I've generally not been too successful. Here are some varied interests:

* Quizzes
* Indiepop music
* Videogames
* Independent cinema
* Geocaching
* Existentialist woe
* Awful, awful puns
* Liberal politics / economics

Places you can find me
----------------------

There are also some places on the internet you can find me that I don't mind sharing.

* [This blog](http://blog.burythehammer.com/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/burythehammer)
* [Github](https://github.com/burythehammer/)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burythehammer)
* [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/burythehammer)

What I've worked on
------------------

It could have been a brilliant career.

* [Hearthwiz](https://hearthwiz.herokuapp.com/) - A personal project, a Hearthstone webapp written in Rails.
* [ITV Player](http://beta.itv.com/itvplayer/) - Automated functional testing, performance testing, manual testing, and general team pessimist.
* [Sedex Advance](http://www.sedexglobal.com/introducing-sedex-advance/) - Functional test developer. Refactorer-in-chief.
* [useMango](http://infuse.it/test-tools/usemango/about/) - Lead tester. Not enough influence to change that awful name.
* [Top secret government stuff](https://youtu.be/6iaR3WO71j4) - I'm not supposed to talk about this.

Thanks
