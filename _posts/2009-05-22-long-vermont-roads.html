The scenery in Montreal was okay, but within a couple hours south and you've crossed the border, it becomes quite impressive. It's almost a little like the geography knows it has to change, because you've changed country. The trees become a verdant, lush rug across the landscape, vast and uninterrupted. The hills are long and rolling, but seem to be always miles away. You just lose all sense of distance.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Barely anyone lives there. We stayed in a hotel in a relatively populous town, Rutland, which had about 40,000 people. On the way there, though, the road passed through innumerable small villages, all with their own local shops, farms and motels. This is the thing about Vermont which I've not noticed about any other state: there isn't a chain to be seen. Every village appears to have its own brand of bank, its own hotels, its own restaurants. It's tranquil and untouched by corporate America. Which is lovely, it really is, and gives the endless winding roads real character.<br &#47;><br &#47;>We only had one night in Rutland, which meant we only had the day we arrived to explore. As soon as we checked in, we set about quickly finding a walk to do. The only walks appeared to be real hiking trails, but we thought we could find one and walk a bit along it and then back. We even brought a couple of beers. Then it turned out that we found the Appalachian Trail.<br &#47;><br &#47;>

<div>I had been reading about this place, this very holiday, in Bill Bryson's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0767902521&#47;$%7B0%7D">A Walk in the Woods<&#47;a>. It's a hiking trail that winds over about 2000 miles, from Georgia (that's deep south) to Maine (practically Canada). I can't say the views were impressive, but I enjoyed the walk nonetheless. A little tiring, as it was largely up a mountain. I think Mark probably hated me a little for it.<&#47;div><&#47;div><&#47;div></p>
