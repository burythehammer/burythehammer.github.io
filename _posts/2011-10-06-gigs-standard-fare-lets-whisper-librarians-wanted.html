<p>I'm not sure if it's really the intention behind the song&nbsp;<em>Philadelphia, <&#47;em>but I've definitely waited more than a year to see Standard Fare. Once frequent supporters on the indiepop scene, their appearances have slowed to a trickle, if at all. I suppose they're busy with a new album, and their myriad appearances - say, supporting Allo Darlin' on their official album launch at the Lexington - were mainly to promote <em>The Noyelle Beat<&#47;em>, their debut album. Still, it's <em>very<&#47;em>&nbsp;good to see them again.</p>
<p>Opening for the both of them were Owl &amp; Mouse. Because I'm a terminal slacker, I missed them. From their <a href="http:&#47;&#47;owlandmouse.bandcamp.com">bandcamp <&#47;a>I'm mainly sorry for my ever suffering girlfriend - who is a big folk fan, and came with me that night. They're extremely delicate acoustic folk - music that would really hush a crowd and get them to listen. They're London based (even with a song about Finsbury Park!) so hopefully I will get another chance to catch them.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5316.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" title="DSCF5316" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5316.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a><strong>Let's Whisper<&#47;strong>&nbsp;are an extremely rare treat for UK-based indiepoppers. They're an offshoot of The Smittens, who amount to the twee-est band in existence. They're notorious for ridiculous things like a song about gumdrops, whose video is in<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=eyoR7Pch6Uo">&nbsp;an elementary school library<&#47;a>, or perhaps staging gigs in&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=I2vwCYblV4U">pyjama&nbsp;parties<&#47;a>, or hosting workshops about how to write the perfect pop song (if you were there, apparently the perfect pop song has the lyric "What are you doing in my tent &#47; Are you a man from the government?").</p>
<p>Being based in Vermont, they don't come over here much (although Max Smitten used to live and work in Leeds) - but it's easier to get two of them over. Hence Let's Whisper, a side-project with Colin Smitten and Dana Smitten, and in this case guesting with Emma from Standard Fare on bass.</p>
<p>Last I saw Let's Whisper, they were doing an acoustic set on the trains at Indietracks. This seemed to suit them pretty well, but hell, they sounded about 10 times better on stage. Although the twee element might put some off, some of their songs are <em>ridiculously&nbsp;<&#47;em>catchy, even surpassing their work in the Smittens.&nbsp;A personal highlight for me was&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=tN9fVTBEal4">When You Were Eating Ice Cream<&#47;a>, probably for the reason that I've chatted with Colin Smitten whilst queuing for ice-cream at Indietracks, first thing after we got up. I'm not sure what he usually eats for breakfast, anyway.</p>
<p>Weepop has several songs available for free which you can check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.letswhisper.com&#47;?page_id=15">here<&#47;a>!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5337.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-522" title="Standard Fare" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5337.jpg" alt="Standard Fare" width="1200" height="896" &#47;><&#47;a><strong>Standard Fare<&#47;strong> stole the show, though. As I mentioned earlier, generally I've always seen them as a support band, which is incredibly unfair - if anything, <em>The Noyelle Beat<&#47;em>&nbsp;was probably one of my favourite albums from last year. Embodying efficiency in band design, there are only three of them, the guitarist and bassist sharing vocal duties. Emma, the bassist, usually dominates though, and her voice has a gravelly, dry, and emotionally charged element that adds to their sound in so many ways. Especially during the peak of some of their songs - take <em>Love Doesn't Just Stop&nbsp;- <&#47;em>she practically screams some of it.</p>
<p>Not that that's the only thing to comment about. Standard Fare are a little odd for indiepop, because they don't really sound all that much like your typical indiepop band. At times they sound like a pop-punk band, like <em>Edges &amp; Corners <&#47;em>(nobody else seems to love that song, but it's my favourite on the album).&nbsp;At this gig they were on top form, and it's one of the best times I've seen them live. Perhaps it's because I'm more familiar with their songs - maybe it was because Colin Smitten was yowling half of the time - but most of the songs sounded spot on. The best reception was reserved for <em>Philadelphia<&#47;em>, a near universal love story about being stranded far away from your loved one. Most of the crowd was singing and dancing along, which I definitely don't remember from before - perhaps a testament to how they're growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Whilst they generally stuck to material from their debut for this gig, they did get the chance to air some new material.&nbsp;This was the first time I got to listen to Darth Vader, which I assumed was going to be a strong new single, but it's a slow, sad song. I'm not sure quite how I feel about it yet, but here's an acoustic version they've released on youtube:</p>
