<p>I have a <i>five<&#47;i> day weekend incoming. This is not related to music. But it is a good reason to have a corny title (BIG weekend? aho!).
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Last Friday, I spontaneously gathered some AMS crew together to go to White Light, who were doing Wet Dog's launch party. The backing band were fun but seemed to scare the living shit out of everyone else I came with - they sounded a little like Cabaret Voltaire&#47;Throbbing Gristle at times, with a bit less emphasis on electronic instruments and more on guitar noise. It was definitely at times more art than music, and experimental, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.<&#47;div>

The heavy, funky bass lines on their songs, the DIY instruments that resembled blocks of wood, all great.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Afterwards we indulged in some downright silliness, had some drinks, fucked around on the comfortable couch we found at the back of The Lexington, and then did some shisha after walking what felt like TEN FUCKING MILES to Camden.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;Sw3AVjPZc4I&#47;AAAAAAAADK8&#47;b9RLFR-4w-Y&#47;s1600&#47;P1040504.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;Sw3AVjPZc4I&#47;AAAAAAAADK8&#47;b9RLFR-4w-Y&#47;s320&#47;P1040504.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408190204011443074" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;>That is what can loosely be referred to as "the crew". I am sure they will not mind me calling them that. For extra creepiness, check out the bar guy picking up the glass behind them. Well, it creeps me <i>the fuck out.<&#47;i><&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Also in the news this week: finally got my hands on the Pocketbooks and Butcher Boy albums, which are great. Missed the Rough Trade quiz (fell asleep at 6pm), missed one half of Pains of Being Pure at Heart at White Heat (8am meeting next day, ugh). I do have lots of stuff planned for December though, in some ways, too much stuff.<&#47;div>
