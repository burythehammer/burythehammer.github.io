Programmable infrastructure is similar to software, and needs testing too.

I've written a post over at the OpenCredo blog about [Testing Programmable Infrastructure](https://opencredo.com/programmable-infrastructure-needs-testing/).

Here's the skinny:

> Programmable infrastructure is similar to software, and needs testing too. In this article, I argue that I describe some of the unique challenges the industry faces in adopting infrastructure testing: both cultural and technical. I end by pointing out where we can go from here: we need to talk about it more, identify best practice, and improve our tooling.

This is also the basis for my talk "Testing Programmable Infrastructure", which I presented at QCon and a few meetups around London. You can see a video of the talk [here](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/opencredo-ruby).
