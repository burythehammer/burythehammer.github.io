Hello!

I am a twenty something guy who works in tech, and likes discussing pop culture. This is my personal website, named after a relatively obscure [Beat Happening song](https://youtu.be/NTZ7duah7aM).

What I Do
---------

I work as a QA/Developer-in-test at [OpenCredo](https://www.opencredo.com/), an open-source software consultancy, and you can read a more professional work profile [over here](https://www.opencredo.com/company/people/matthew-long/). If I was really pressed to describe what I do (say, on a quiz show, with Alexander Armstrong hoping I say something interesting), I would probably just say software developer, but that would lose the nuance that I specialise in testing. If you're interested in hiring me, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burythehammer) is the place to go.

Interests
---------

In my spare time, I try to avoid being a hipster, but I'm generally not too successful. Here are some varied interests:

* Quizzes
* Indiepop music
* Videogames
* Independent cinema
* Geocaching
* Existentialist woe
* Puns
* Liberal politics / economics
* Statistics

There are also some places on the internet you can find me that I don't mind sharing.

What I've worked on
------------------
