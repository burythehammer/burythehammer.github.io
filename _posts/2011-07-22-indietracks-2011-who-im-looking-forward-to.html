<p>Indietracks, as well as being <em>the<&#47;em>&nbsp;best place to see indiepop in the world, is also a personal highlight of the year. With only a week to go, I thought I'd give a run down of some of the artists I enjoy that are playing. Huge disclaimer, though: the joy of Indietracks is discovering something new. I haven't heard of a lot of the bands on the list! There will be&nbsp;lots of new discoveries and crazy adventures, as there have been every year. Last year, someone from The Chemistry Experiment overheard a poor joke I made, and offered me a beer they had. We waited with Be Like Pablo in the queue for White Town, before they dragged us off to see Ballboy, with occasional chants of "<em>Baaaaaallboy!" <&#47;em>in thick Scottish accents. A crazy woman made me &nbsp;feed a button to a fabric hedgehog, and then sang a beautiful song (that would have been a lot better if I wasn't on my way to the toilet).</p>
<p>On with the bands. I think I'm going to do it in a few parts to stop myself getting exhausted.</p>

Originally caught them at Indietracks 2009, and despite being underwhelmed at their appearance, by the time they started playing, they humbled me.&nbsp;A mix of deep female vocals, sparkling guitars, deep bass, and haunting synth, with heartfelt lyrics. The vocals are really the standout part: Lucille D Campbell's voice is an extraordinary beast, sounding like a hash between Nico and a female Morrissey, especially given the deeply emotional lyrics.&nbsp;They describe themselves as indiepop &#47; krautrock, but I'd venture there are influences from all over - resulting in a unique sound.</p>

<p>M&amp;PC are appearing on at the same time as Help Stamp Out Loneliness, which I'm very conflicted about. I'm probably verging on seeing M&amp;PC - not because they're better, but because they're from the USA and don't play over here much (in fact, according to their website it's the first time <em>ever!<&#47;em>). Math and Physics Club play indiepop in the finest tradition: every song is a heartbreak in twangy guitars and desperate lyrics, recalling both elements of The Smiths in their music, and Belle &amp; Sebastian style vocals.&nbsp;Both of their albums are amazing, making it easy for them to play a set full of hits. They're playing a special pre-Indietracks London show, which I am not going to miss for anything.</p>

<h1>Pocketbooks - <em>Outdoor Stage, Friday<&#47;em><&#47;h1><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1040012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-339" title="Pocketbooks @ Indietracks 09" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1040012.jpg" alt="Pocketbooks @ Indietracks 09" width="1024" height="693" &#47;><&#47;a>The Friday is a very special evening, as for some it'll be their very first taste of Indietracks. There's only one stage, meaning everyone is&nbsp;together, and there's no rushing around between bands. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. The opening band has a very special duty to fulfil, and I cannot think of anyone else better than Pocketbooks. They're about the easiest band in the world to enjoy. I'm really looking forward to drinking a beer out on the hill, not a care in the world, watching the sunset behind the main stage, listening to some comforting and familiar tunes.</p>
