<p>Oh! A new release. Well, I never. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;zumutung.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-478" title="zumutung" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;zumutung.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="600" &#47;><&#47;a> Of all the releases I anticipated this year, I can't say that Wake the President was one of them. If anything, I thought they were dead. They were a pretty big deal two or three years ago with the release of <em>You Can't Change That Boy - <&#47;em>full of straight up indiepop classics, enjoyable without having to try too hard. <em>Zumutung!<&#47;em>&nbsp;is a different matter, though. Just like its title, it's a sudden, unwelcome imposition into my life - I feel I <em>have<&#47;em>&nbsp;to enjoy it out of duty for the band. My patience reaps rewards, though.</p>
<p>This is a far deeper album, and a band who want&nbsp;to be taken seriously. It succeeds somewhat. The album opens with <em>She Fell Into My Arms<&#47;em>, an obvious first single. I feel dubious about this one, though. It feels a bit strained, a bit too "yeah, let's make a single song". <em>Your Expressions, <&#47;em>next,&nbsp;hits the mark much more naturally, and is the kind of song you've come to expect. The guitars are jangly but have a curious scratchy quality, and ebb out over the entire song. In a change for the band, the bass and drums fade out in favour of giving the guitar more precedence.</p>
<p>The effect is to give the band a more mature, less indie-pop feel, favouring atmosphere over melody. In fact, a few songs down,&nbsp;<em>This is New<&#47;em>&nbsp;is just out-and-out dark, like they've taken lessons from Interpol. <em>This is New<&#47;em>&nbsp;is probably the best that the album has to offer, and an interesting pointer to where the band will head next. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF48991.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-479" title="Wake the President" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;09&#47;DSCF48991.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" &#47;><&#47;a> What I find really interesting, though, is the end of the album. The beginning reels us in with the familiar, poppy tunes, but with a slightly darker, more mature edge. The end shows us where the band are thinking of going: <em>Stockholm's&nbsp;<&#47;em><em>Archipelago<&#47;em>&nbsp;is almost post-rock in its influence, with an aching soundscape and cymbals like clashes of waves. It's a clear nod to the Swedish heritage the brothers in the band have, and it's a vastly more successful end to the album than A&amp;E for the last (I usually just turn off at that point - sorry lads). With repeated listens it's a delightful song that shows a great amount of emotional depth, something they've only hinted at until now.</p>
<p><em>Zumutung!<&#47;em>&nbsp;is an interesting album. It's normal on your second effort to show you're capable of more. It sometimes succeeds, it sometimes fails. Although it fails to supply the sheer amount of hits that their first album had - and that's probably where the album fails most - but it shows a subtle change of direction for a band that risked&nbsp;pigeon-holing as 'just another Scottish indiepop band'.</p>
<p>So you can see what I'm talking about, here's my favourite track from the album, called&nbsp;<em>This is New.<&#47;em></p>
