I've got some free, non-billable time at the moment at work, so they've let me do a bit of research and development, as well as some technical blog posts.

I can't reproduce them here (they're written on company time, so it's fair enough they have it exclusively on their site), but it feels silly not to link over to any stuff I do.

For my first post, I've written about my work on the Sedex Advance project. I started pretty much as soon as I joined OpenCredo, and I was impressed by the technical wizardry they had employed. Some of the advanced architectural design we used impacted my work as a tester, so I've written up my reflections on what kind of difficulties we had, and the kind of techniques we used to combat them. It's also, from a tester's perspective, a good introduction to the architecture if you've not encountered it before.

> [Microservices is a] great architectural style when implemented correctly. However, microservices bring inherent operational complexity, which you canâ€™t ignore, and your testing strategy will have to reflect this.
