<p>I'm suffering from a bit of post-Indietracks burnout, so lately I haven't had much to speak of that would be of much interest - aside from a lot of <em>The Wire<&#47;em>&nbsp;and some <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.humblebundle.com&#47;">Humble Indie Bundle #3,<&#47;a> life has been pretty boring recently. Some of my thoughts on the bundle soon, but this is primarily an indiepop blog, so more of that first.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;IMG_3732-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455" title="White Town" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;IMG_3732-2.jpg" alt="White Town" width="1200" height="711" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Those who are familiar with one-hit wonders will recognise the name White Town -&nbsp;when I caught sole member Jyoti Mishra performing at Indietracks this year (an acoustic set in the merch tent), he referred to <em>Your Woman <&#47;em>as "the only #1 single I have.. and am likely to ever have". Which is a shame really, because although the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=cIQWt3oMids&amp;ob=av3e">aforementioned&nbsp;song<&#47;a> is catchy enough to top the charts, most of White Town is of a similar ilk. I guess it's a reflection upon how music becomes popular - some attach the name of the band to it, others only remember the song. Dexys Midnight Runners were popular as a <em>band<&#47;em>&nbsp;in the UK, with a couple of enormously successful albums, but only had one really famous song in the US. Why? God knows. Music PR is a strange and mysterious business, with great songs getting ignored and The Kings of Leon becoming famous.</p>
<p>Whilst hits like that only come along every once in a while, I'm glad to see that the average output of White Town is actually pretty good. The acoustic set was touching, Jyoti's voice actually being very soft (for a large, perpetually grinning&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;man), and the tone is sentimental with subtle melodies. His new single, <em>She's a Lot Like You <&#47;em>is a breezy tune with hand claps and a tale of an odd love triangle - but what you'll mainly remember is that it's so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">damn catchy<&#47;span><em>. <&#47;em>The tone is summery and perfectly complemented by the video that accompanies it, and makes me especially nostalgic for Indietracks. Jyoti was looking for volunteers for the video, but my partner and I never followed through, which is a shame - the video is an indiepop spotters dream, with&nbsp;appearances&nbsp;from Help Stamp Out Loneliness, Allo Darlin', Pocketbooks, Stolen Wine Social, Oddbox Records, Moustache of Insanity, Horowitz..</p>
<p>You can get the single for a measly 50p <a href="http:&#47;&#47;whitetown.bandcamp.com&#47;track&#47;shes-a-lot-like-you">right here<&#47;a>.</p>
