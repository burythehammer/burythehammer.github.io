  content: So, what's the soundtrack for your travels? Do you and Mark have the same
    musical taste? Then again, maybe you're listening to your iPod. A bit boring for
    Mark, I would have thought, on those long drives. <br &#47;><br &#47;>How is Mark
    finding the driving, anyway, and are you sticking to the interstates to get between
    the Big Cities you are visiting?<br &#47;><br &#47;>Your mum and dad left for
    home today. Just Grandma here now. Are you heading our way, and if so, what's
    your ETA?<br &#47;><br &#47;>Grandma would like to tell Mark that she is sorry
    that she won't have the chance to see him at Wembley this season. Well, a little
    sorry, but mostly delighted to see City promoted. Er, we won't mention Norwich.<br
    &#47;><br &#47;>All the best, <br &#47;><br &#47;>Dave

  content: I had the foresight to bring a huge load of CDs along with me, although
    they're running thin. Recently I've discovered I remembered to bring an auxillary
    cable, so I've been playing directly from my ipod (without one of those ridiculously
    expensive ipod docks). Our musical tastes overlap to a degree, although my tastes
    can be obscure at times.<br &#47;><br &#47;>The driving has been copeable, we've
    been breaking up the journey a lot more than we originally planned, which is probably
    better in the long run. We're avoiding toll roads but sticking to the interstates
    (generally following Google Maps' advice).<br &#47;><br &#47;>You've got info
    on when we'll be in Ottawa, and waiting at this very moment for Grandma&#47;Fran&#47;etc
    to arrive at the hotel.

<p>As I type this, I'm in Columbus, Ohio, yet to explore the city. Brother and I are going to go exploring some bars near the university later, but I'm going to take the opportunity here to make some miscellaneous observations.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Americans very much seem to have modes where they really want something, but lack it from that into their ordinary lives. They sort of have modes where they take something rather than incorporate it into their surroundings. Take an example: history. There are very heavily historical districts, but they like it to be cordoned off. Enjoyed for a day out, when they feel like it. Americans seem to complain they don't have much history, but it's just experienced in a different manner to Europe. We're surrounded by it back home, it's part of our everyday lives. Period houses are very desirable, and city centres tend to be a dolly mixture of the very old and the modern, cathedrals next to office blocks, and such. Another one is scenery. Go a few miles out of the suburbs or off the interstate, you'll find lush wilderness hardly found in the UK. Driving through the Appalachians reminded me of north wales. Not exactly the same, but the same feeling of awe, isolation, and natural beauty. Fitness is another: no pedestrians, only the larger cities have (some) cyclists. DC center had a lot of joggers and cyclists, but the vast majority of Americans who exercise seem to do it in climate controlled running factories. Which they drive to.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Another thing I've noticed, and been severely warned about by Bill <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Bryson<&#47;span>: pedestrianisation. It doesn't exist. You're some sort of massive weirdo if you walk any sort of distance outside of an inner city. We were walking from our hotel in Pittsburgh towards a bar, and it must have been just under a mile walk. Was there a sidewalk there? Was there hell. We walked down the side of the road, getting dirty shoes and being honked at by presumably bemused motorists. Most bars are far away and out the reach of public transport (which is shoddy at best). It doesn't surprise me why there's a problem with drink driving in the US, or that the drinking age is so high, or that there's less of a drinking culture here. How the hell are a group of people meant to go out for the night if you can't get to the bar and back? It defies explanation.<br &#47;><br &#47;>On the brighter side of US culture, the attitude towards business seems to be generally healthier here. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Entrepreneurial<&#47;span> spirit is high, service is better, competition seems to be better amongst most markets. Profit, in general, is not a dirty word, because they understand it means more jobs. They also seem to be more computer savvy, and do things more efficiently. Smaller businesses seem to do better, too, and I've seen lots of adverts for all kinds of things. Adverts are also a lot more informative in nature. When's the last time back home you saw an advert that was trying to tell you something? Rather than the European 'lifestyle' type adverts, more about associating their brand with a particular way of living. Beer adverts that are about making blokey jokes than the taste&#47;price, or mobile phone adverts which is more about making it look cool or sophisticated than actually talk about the features.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Also, the Americans know how to make a hearty meal. We went in Denny's earlier and I was fit to burst after only having spent about $8 (full breakfast platter plus a stack of pancakes), and it was damn tasty too. Although it will probably make me die of a heart attack if I eat that every morning. Inner fatness indeed.</p>
