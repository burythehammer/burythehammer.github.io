<p>By the way, I've uploaded all the photos on Facebook, but for those who aren't on that (aka family), you can also check them out here:<br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.co.uk&#47;PsychoDave&#47;AmericaPt1?authkey=Gv1sRgCI28zN7X5YKTFw#">New York<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;><a href="http:&#47;&#47;picasaweb.google.co.uk&#47;PsychoDave&#47;AmericaPt2Philly?authkey=Gv1sRgCI-D5I36vv7ohAE">Philly<&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>My camera is kind of broken, but I'm going to see whether I can get it fixed in Chicago, or maybe buy a new one (sigh). For now, we only have Mark's iphone camera, which we used in DC.</p>
