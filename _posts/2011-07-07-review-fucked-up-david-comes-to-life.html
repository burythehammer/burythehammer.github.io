    Fucked Up are also indiepop-tastic in more unexpected ways:

  content: Yeah, I saw that from a while ago. I wonder if they're secretly all indiepop
    fans.

<p>The concept of <em>David Comes to Life<&#47;em>&nbsp;is a story of love (and loss) between a blue collar factory worker and a trade union activist in 1970s England.</p>
<p>The band Fucked Up, however, are a hardcore punk band from Toronto, Canada. How they came to write about this, I have absolutely no clue. What I do know, however, is that this is an album that manages to transcend genres. I'm slowly growing colder towards hard rock music, but this is really something else - I love it completely. The guitars are intricate, the melodies strong, and the vocals both interesting and passionate. For an overweight, angry white guy (who often goes topless at live shows), this is surprisingly poetic stuff. I saw a youtube video once with the lyrics overlaid, and it blew me&nbsp;away. For an indiepop fan, there's also a heavy dabbling of female vocals, which is a lovely addition (and doesn't sound anything at all like&nbsp;Evanescence).</p>
<p>My picks of the album are definitely Queen of Hearts and Turn the Season. Madator, bless their hearts, have even given free MP3 downloads of the former. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.matadorrecords.com&#47;mpeg&#47;fucked_up&#47;fucked_up_queen_of_hearts.mp3">Download<&#47;a> and enjoy.</p>
