<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The amount of gigs I've been to since I've last updated is scary. I've been weighed under by a combination of work and actually going out. It's ironic that I don't have enough time to write about them because I'm so busy going to them. So here's a pictorial update.<&#47;span>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Wild Palms 26&#47;11<br &#47;><&#47;span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGSDlS0KaI&#47;AAAAAAAADLg&#47;-drlRFW2i_g&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040529.JPG"><&#47;a><&#47;span>
<div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGSDlS0KaI&#47;AAAAAAAADLg&#47;-drlRFW2i_g&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040529.JPG" style="text-decoration: none;"><img style="text-align: left;display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px; " src="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGSDlS0KaI&#47;AAAAAAAADLg&#47;-drlRFW2i_g&#47;s320&#47;P1040529.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413768817324337570" &#47;><&#47;a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Well, that pretty much says it all, doesn't it? The most dingy gig I've been to in a long time. It felt like it wasn't so much of a gig as some homeless people squatting with guitars. With some art. And expensive beer.<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGTtS_b00I&#47;AAAAAAAADLw&#47;19qRfsLJp-E&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040520.JPG" style="text-decoration: none;"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGTtS_b00I&#47;AAAAAAAADLw&#47;19qRfsLJp-E&#47;s320&#47;P1040520.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413770633477346114" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div><&#47;div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I didn't actually get to stay for Wild Palms, I saw the supporting act, realised it was already quite late, and that I wanted to go to Wallfly Exhibition's opening. Probably would have been better to do it the other way round, as Wallfly closed early, and had free beer. And it's not like you'd spend more than about 20 minutes there anyway.<br &#47;><br &#47;><&#47;span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGUes32q_I&#47;AAAAAAAADL4&#47;B1g1l_M0MlQ&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040532.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGUes32q_I&#47;AAAAAAAADL4&#47;B1g1l_M0MlQ&#47;s320&#47;P1040532.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413771482238462962" &#47;><&#47;a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I happen to have an entire wall of my bedroom covered with music-related flyers, so this exhibit appealed to me particularly -appreciating some people put many, MANY hours into making distinctive, beautiful artwork to promote their band and clubnights. There was not as much as I expected - six or seven pieces. It was also in a nail salon. In Dalston. Suffice to say, not <&#47;span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">everyone<&#47;span><&#47;i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> is going to appreciate that this is pretty much a scene exclusive event.<br &#47;><br &#47;><&#47;span>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Basement Scam 27&#47;11<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The Sexual Objects, The Tamborines, A Classic Education, Standard Fare<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Basement Scam at the Buffalo Bar is always fun. It's run by the head honcho of Fortuna Pop, Sean, and although it seems to centre around indiepop, it branches out into all sorts of other genres.<&#47;span><&#47;div><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGYMIzQ13I&#47;AAAAAAAADMA&#47;w8Y0XMyOVzA&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040541.JPG"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGYMIzQ13I&#47;AAAAAAAADMA&#47;w8Y0XMyOVzA&#47;s320&#47;P1040541.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413775561364395890" &#47;><&#47;a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I missed the first band (Standard Fare), but A Classic Education were really quite superb. I think the word I'd use to describe them would be 'ghostly'. The vocals are really eerily beautiful, and the music is toned down to really let them shine.<&#47;span>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGZU7brCZI&#47;AAAAAAAADMI&#47;IpoF81AygPs&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040549.JPG" style="text-decoration: none;"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGZU7brCZI&#47;AAAAAAAADMI&#47;IpoF81AygPs&#47;s320&#47;P1040549.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413776811906238866" &#47;><&#47;a><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The Tamborines were much rougher. What you'll notice in the picture is that they toned down the red glare and instead used an epilepsy inducing light. They sounded like a mix between hard rock, shoegaze, and post rock, like a dreamy <&#47;span><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Glasgow Mega Snake<&#47;span><&#47;i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">. I'm probably talking out of my arse. They were really great.<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><&#47;div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGahQhFUqI&#47;AAAAAAAADMQ&#47;RdJfz5u9TV4&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040553.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;2.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGahQhFUqI&#47;AAAAAAAADMQ&#47;RdJfz5u9TV4&#47;s320&#47;P1040553.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413778123236135586" &#47;><&#47;a>
<div><&#47;div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Now, I'm not going to say The Sexual Objects were bad. They were pretty great. Considering they're related to The Fire Engines, however, I was expecting more. I'd say the Tamborines were a more enjoyable band all round, perhaps because they came out of nowhere and really surprised me. Bands do that.<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Warp20<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Battles, Flying Lotus, Plaid + others<&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><&#47;div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Saturday. I had nothing to do, then suddenly a billion people accost me at once. Nick, an old AMS friend, asked if I was going to Warp20. Then Greg, of <&#47;span><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.musicmetric.com&#47;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">http:&#47;&#47;www.musicmetric.com&#47;<&#47;span><&#47;a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"> (a musical trends and statistics company), asked if I was going to go to a Felix do. Then Anastasia, from Twee as Fuck, asks me if I want to come to Girls! Girls! Girls! at Old Blue Last. Then Greg suggests we go see Battles. Turns out Battles are playing at Warp20, so they're the same gig, let's go meet Nick, we can all go to Old Blue Last if things turn tits up. Cool. And just a couple of hours before, I thought I was going to have a quiet night in. Being popular is difficult.<&#47;span><&#47;div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;><&#47;span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGmBoreAcI&#47;AAAAAAAADMY&#47;Rw5s5R9d46Q&#47;s1600-h&#47;P1040609.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SyGmBoreAcI&#47;AAAAAAAADMY&#47;Rw5s5R9d46Q&#47;s320&#47;P1040609.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5413790774105866690" &#47;><&#47;a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><br &#47;>That's Battles, there. I'm not the biggest fan in the world, but they were pretty awesome. It's just a pity my videos sounded like BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM rather than actual music.<&#47;span></p>
