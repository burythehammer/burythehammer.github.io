<p>Despite my recent early nights, I saw the wonderful Delorean, a chilled out summer mix between rave and experimental rock, who are well worth checking out. I suppose they would end up sounding like Animal Collective, but I actually enjoy them (and if you have me talking about it you'll understand the fervour of dislike I have for them). The gig was hot, sweaty, delirious and wonderfully enjoyable. It might have been inside, but it felt like I was at a festival, they captured the essence just perfectly. Summer is most certainly here. The fact I'm leaving for Indietracks in just under a week has not escaped me. I would have liked to have gone to Latitude, but it falls just within summer term. It'd probably be possible to make the Friday evening, but not the Monday morning. And you know what Indietracks means, don't you? it means Indietracks warm up gigs! Allo Darlin' are playing next Wednesday at the Luminaire with THE SMITTENS and Antarctica Takes It, and on Thursday I have the rather difficult choice between:</p>
<p>#1: Indietrash, with a band I have co-opted as my personal discovery, The Felt Tips, who I have the TOP RESULT on youtube.</p>
<p>#2: A mixup of some London indiepop superstars at How Does it Feel, with Pocketbooks, Shrag, Tender Trap, Antarctica Takes It and Betty and the Werewolves. Tender Trap is Amelia Fletcher's band. Amelia Fletcher is the SUPERSTAR of the twee scene, being not only in Tallulah Gosh and Heavenly, but also being CHIEF ECONOMIST at the Office of Fair Trading. WOW! I'm already in love.</p>
