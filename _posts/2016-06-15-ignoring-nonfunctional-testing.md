Testing is always focused on functional testing. Non-functional testing, by comparison, is treated like a second class citizen. This means that functional requirements get refined, and non-functional requirements are ignored until the very end.

I've written a [blog](https://opencredo.com/ignoring-non%C2%ADfunctional-testing/) over at OpenCredo about this.

It's enormously frustrating. I'm a QA Consultant, allegedly, but spend most of my time on functional requirements. If anything, quality depends on everything aside from what your application does. How easy is it to use? Do your users enjoy using your application? Is it better than your competition? These things always get pushed to the side!
