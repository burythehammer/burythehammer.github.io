Here is a video I dug up of the Lucksmiths' final UK gig, their final ever song, the sublime <i>The Chapter in Your Life Entitled San Francisco<&#47;i>. I was browsing through old videos of mine (for WoW nostalgia more than music but hey), and this prompted a massive Lucksmiths binge.<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>And a somewhat more worrying period of "that was an awesome gig, why do I not remember it until just now", and then a more generally worrying "I keep forgetting awesome periods of my life".<br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>Okay stop there daddio, let's stop getting philosophical. But seriously. The Lucksmiths are great. I only have like 2-3 albums, I need more. <i>Warmer Corners<&#47;i> is absolutely, irrevocably, fantastic, one warm pop song after another. I found it quite bland at first, and I realised after a month I'd probably listened to the album 20 times through - it's a real grower, and most of the great songs don't stand out at first. It's a combination of the warm, literate and surprisingly witty lyrics, and just how <i>listenable<&#47;i> it all is (spellchecker is telling me that's not a word, well, fuck you too buddy). I got <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.victortrumper.com&#47;articles&#47;lucksmiths.htm">Victor Trumper<&#47;a> off a compilation and it's a different, simpler, kind of awesome. So next I think I'll plop into their earlier stuff.</p>
