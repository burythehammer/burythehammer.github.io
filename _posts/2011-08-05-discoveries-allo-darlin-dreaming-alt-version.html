<p>So, I've listened to my Indietracks mixtape recently, and I'm pleased to report two things: not only are there plenty of new discoveries here, but it's very good (it also makes an acrostic 'INDIETRACKS RULES' when you look at the first letter of the artists!).</p>
<p>One of the new discoveries though, is plain odd. Along with Toby from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;thepunchtable.blogspot.com">The Punch Table<&#47;a>, we're pretty much the biggest Allo' Darlin fans&nbsp;we know (15 live shows and counting). Which is why I'm startled to hear an unreleased version of their single <em>Dreaming<&#47;em>. It has the same structure, but produced completely differently.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;P1050494.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-428" title="Allo Darlin'" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;P1050494.jpg" alt="Allo Darlin'" width="1024" height="545" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>First off, it has a way more sedate pace. The&nbsp;ukulele&nbsp;part has completely changed. The bass is deep, loud and slow, and&nbsp;Elizabeth&nbsp;has an almost ghostly feel to her voice with a sad tone. Monster Bobby is also there, and his party hasn't been changed much - but he never sounded happy in the first place. The original song is nostalgic and happy, easily worthy of a single. This is the kind of thing I would expect of <em>Tallulah<&#47;em>&nbsp;or <em>Emily<&#47;em>, it's a soft song filled with regrets and dreaming of better days.</p>
<p>Here's a sampler:</p>
