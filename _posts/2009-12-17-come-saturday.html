<p>People on Facebook may have already seen this (this blog auto-exports there), but it's worth posting again because it has to do with music, and well, I put a lot of effort into it. Sadly, Facebook does not support embedded videos on blog feeds, but here's a link anyhow. And you guys should be clicking "view original post" anyhow?</p>
<div>Anyway. This is my own little tribute to Twee as Fuck, now that the last one is over. It's got some lovely music by The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and My Bloody Valentine, has some terrible lo-fi photos, and is generally shit and awesome at the same time. A bit like Schroedinger's Cat. Who knew I could relate twee and the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics?<&#47;div></p>
