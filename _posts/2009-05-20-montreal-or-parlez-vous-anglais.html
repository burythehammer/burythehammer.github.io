<div>I had warned my brother multiple times that Quebec was like an entirely different country, but to be honest, I kind of wasn't prepared myself. It's another place. And no matter how much you really know about it, you still kind of feel out of your element there.<br &#47;><br &#47;>For all that people know that Canadians speak a lot of French, Quebec is by far the most strident in its bilingualism. French is actually the dominent language in Montreal, and you are expected to at least exchange basic pleasantries in it. My french is sadly appalling<em> <&#47;em>(Mark's is none better) so most of the time I ended up speaking english. It still excited me to practice a bit of reading, deciphering random signs and watching snatches of television: including an extremely amusing episode of<em> Pimp Mon Char<&#47;em>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>(yes, we watched pimp my ride, I am not ashamed in the least)<br &#47;><br &#47;><&#47;div><&#47;div>
<div><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338916432708824962" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 246px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;1.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;ShekNXEa74I&#47;AAAAAAAACng&#47;n1seIcyp8WU&#47;s320&#47;P1020652.JPG" border="0" &#47;><br &#47;>It's not just the language, though. At the risk of paraphrasing <em>Pulp Fiction, <&#47;em>it's the little differences. We had been warned that things change between provinces anyway - moreso than american states - so things like traffic lights, post boxes, tax.. it shifts to something else. But there's also the fact that Quebec does not celebrate <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Victoria_Day">Victoria day<&#47;a>, instead celebrates a more politically neutral version called National Patriot's Day. It makes sense: Quebec was founded from a French colony, and therefore was never ruled by Queen Victoria. But it just shows you how radically different, historically, this province is to the rest of the country. It feels quite authentically European, and still appears to be a popular spot for europeans to emigrate to. The choice of restaurants and swanky wine bars is to be envied. <&#47;div><br &#47;>

This comprises some of the oldest buildings in the entire of North America, first colonised in 1657. A lot of the more impressive buildings were actually built later, but the entire area is fascinating. We also visited one of the street markets in the north, and took in a breathtakingly scenic view of the city. It's too much to write, really.<br &#47;><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338917421848640402" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: hand; HEIGHT: 240px; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;ShelG75uu5I&#47;AAAAAAAACnw&#47;gngB4KXkCGc&#47;s320&#47;P1020820.JPG" border="0" &#47;><&#47;div><&#47;div></p>
