  content: Wow, a PDark&#47;Ninten mention. Surprising and nostalgic, small world.

  content: I went under the pseudonym PsychoDave - silly, considering my name isn't
    Dave. Guy I met was Joseph, as in, the one who was involved with Kelli&#47;crystal_starz
    for a bit.

<div style="text-align: left;">After leaving Philadephia, our next stop was Washington DC.<&#47;div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br &#47;><&#47;div><img src="http:&#47;&#47;4.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_0ivWp_0hynY&#47;SoLYOo6lfFI&#47;AAAAAAAADJs&#47;2LzwshJUOWA&#47;s320&#47;IMG_0084.JPG" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5369091451791965266" &#47;>Now, I've heard bad things about DC. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.davegorman.com&#47;">Dave Gorman<&#47;a> said he hated it when he ended up there Googlewhacking, another friend said it was crime ridden, and I had the overall impression it'd just be a bit like.. Democracy Land. I'm not sure where this impression came from, because I had two distinctly seperate experiences in DC, and both were positive.<br &#47;><br &#47;>When we first rolled in, we had some teething troubles. The hotel room only had one bed in, the internet wasn't working properly, the bus was terrible. We were going into town to meet a very old friend I know through forums long passed away (pdark&#47;ninten). We waited at the meeting place, he was very late, but eventually turned up (actually, as we were leaving). All night we hung with Joe and a few of his friends, and had a pretty normal, but fun, night of drinking in the suburbs. We remarked at the time that it would probably be the closest we get to experiencing the average American's evening.<br &#47;>

<p>That's us.<&#47;p>
<p>The next day, after a rather severe hangover, we eventually dragged ourselves for some cheesy siteseeing. Yes, we saw the White House, yes, we saw the Lincoln Memorial, and Capitol Hill, and everything else. We didn't spend a dime on any attractions, just wondered around in the sweltering heat all day. I don't think I'd enjoy living there, but just for the day, it was a spectacular sight. There are a lot of parks for wondering through, everything has been pleasingly (if artificially) set out in perfect symmetry. I think I prefer the UK's haphazard streets, but to see miles of grass and monuments perfectly laid out for miles on end, it kinda takes your breath away.<&#47;p>
<p>My camera has broken though, which is possibly the worst place ever for it to happen. DC is a photogenic place.<&#47;p></p>
