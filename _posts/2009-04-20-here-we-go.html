  content: Surely you've landed by now? :p How's NYC? Really jealous of your trip,
    today's budget has made me want to flee the country. On the plus side, the Chancellor
    himself has pledged to give you a job. Maybe of the hole-digging  variety...

<p>So, we leave tomorrow.
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>I've got to say, the affair of preparing for such an epic journey is slightly anti-climactic. A lot of stuff has already been sorted out (Visa, flights, car rental), so all that there's left is clothes, money and accommodation. Mark has assured me he'll sort out accommodation, so that leaves me with clothes and money.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>I ordered some traveller's cheques earlier, and I'm going to get a bit of cash at the same time as I pick them up, probably at a unfavourable rate, but it's only a small amount.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>It still doesn't <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">feel<&#47;span>&nbsp;like I'm travelling abroad though, especially not for a long period of time. This may be because it's just my brother and I. When you live with your family, and you're going away, you seem to be constantly reminded of an up and coming venture. When you're organising it yourself, you organise so much in advance that it feels like it's never going to come. I mean, we've been discussing this trip since September last year.<&#47;div>
<div><br &#47;><&#47;div>
<div>Alex has come down from York for the weekend, and together with my flatmates we had a picnic in the park. It's really, utterly, gorgeous at the moment, and feels like a summer's day. I hope the weather is as kind to us abroad (I fear it will not be).<&#47;div></p>
