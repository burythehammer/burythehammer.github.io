<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;Shrag-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-284 aligncenter" title="Shrag" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;Shrag-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Shrag" width="300" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a>The most amazing thing about Shrag is how they seem associated with the London indiepop scene. Perhaps it's who the band are friends with, perhaps they take more influence from certain corners than I'm willing to admit. Maybe it's just the record label (WIAIWYA), the owner of which seems to man every indiepop merch stand in existence. I shouldn't be complaining though, I'm all the more happy to have heard of them.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If there was a twee band I'd probably compare Shrag to, it'd be the punky-shouty Bis. Who, strangely enough, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=uTWoIXKZGOg">did the credits<&#47;a> for the Powerpuff Girls. The female vocals are remarkably similar (I'm sure that lead singer Helen is fed up of hearing that) and they both like fast, catchy songs. &nbsp;But Bis sounded pretty twee. Shrag, however, add far more aggression to the mix. <em>Mark E. Smith, <&#47;em>lead singer of post punk band The Fall, is generously referenced as the title of a song, and the influence is obvious.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shrag are at their best when the rhythms are tight and the choruses are catchy. Opener <em>Pregnancy Scene <&#47;em>is a perfect example of this. I'm not too fond of some of their slower tracks, however - I know&nbsp;<em>Forty Five 45s<&#47;em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;popular with fans and the band themselves, but I find them&nbsp;comparatively&nbsp;dull. That said, <em>Talk to the Left<&#47;em>, a tale of poor lovemaking, is extremely funny.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My picks of the album are <em>Pregnancy Scene <&#47;em>and <em>Different Glue<&#47;em>.<&#47;p></p>
