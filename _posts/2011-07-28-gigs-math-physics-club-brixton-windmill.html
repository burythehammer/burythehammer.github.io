<p>Silly Matt forgot that you need to put an SD card in a camera, otherwise it won't take more than about 5 pictures. Very bad quality pics coming up (aren't you excited!).</p>
<p>Support bands. First up, <strong>The Sweet Nothings<&#47;strong>. Despite being the weakest band of the night, they weren't too bad. I worried I would miss them altogether (unlike <a href="http:&#47;&#47;thepunchtable.blogspot.com&#47;">some people I know<&#47;a>). I've not seen&#47;heard them before, making it difficult to judge their performance. I would say they're pretty typical indie&#47;shamblepop with some definite highlights - including a train themed song with train whistles!</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1070056.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-365" title="Pocketbooks" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1070056.jpg" alt="Pocketbooks" width="1024" height="592" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p><strong>Pocketbooks<&#47;strong> were the next band on. On any other night they'd be a good placement for second. Tonight, they're bumped down by the two headliners, who have come all the way from the USA. It's unfair though, because they put on a much stronger set than I've seen of late. I've spoken my concerns about their directions, but they pumped out some old classics (<em>Falling Leaves <&#47;em>and <em>Fleeting Moments<&#47;em>&nbsp;are as strong as they ever have been), and their new songs sounded great. Especially <em>Promises, Promises<&#47;em>, which seemed (strangely!) to help from a lack of violins and from stronger guitars.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1070058.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366" title="P1070058" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;P1070058.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="499" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p><strong>Very Truly Yours<&#47;strong>&nbsp;have toured with M&amp;PC throughout their tour of the UK. I may have incorrectly stated on Twitter and this blog that this was their first <em>ever<&#47;em>&nbsp;gig in the country, but I have been humbly corrected (they played Glasgow and Manchester). I must say that despite knowing nothing of them, they put on a strong set. They're remarkably similar to Math and Physics Club, infused with&nbsp;twee. Female Camera Obscura-esque vocals and sparkling guitars make for easy listening. Whilst I compare them to M&amp;PC, I'd say the songwriting isn't as strong, and their rhythms aren't as tight, but definitely enjoyable, and a great find. If I am free when they're playing at Indietracks, I'll make an effort to find them. I have a feeling I'll leave during their set to stake out a place at the Church stage for A Little Orchestra, though. Oh and yes, that really is the best picture I could take.</p>

<p>What you're probably interested in is <strong>Math and Physics Club. <&#47;strong>Four guys in chequered shirts and thick rimmed glasses<strong>. <&#47;strong>I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm biased on the subject. Around the time I got into the band was an important time in my life, and some of the songs have firmly rooted themselves into my emotions. <em>April Showers<&#47;em>&nbsp;was admittedly poorly performed but I enjoyed every moment of it - it has previously been one of my favourite songs ever (!) and it would be difficult for me not to. They're not much of a live band, however, and it felt a bit rough at times, in contrast to their smooth production. The singer remarked it was their longest tour ever, ranking in at about three gigs thus far (no wonder they've not been abroad yet!). The guitar was tuned&nbsp;way up high, which worked better for some songs than others: <em>Darling, Please Come Home<&#47;em>&nbsp;sounded fantastic, and exactly like I would have wanted it to, but with more punch and emotion than the album version. I remarked in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.burythehammer.com&#47;blog&#47;archives&#47;307">my earlier post&nbsp;<&#47;a>that they had a gallery of hits, and most songs were either recognisable or sounded great. My favourite part was the fact that their encore consisted of "uh, what do we play now?" - and my dear friend next to me shouted for <em>We're So DIY<&#47;em>. I've put that song on mixtapes before to describe the indiepop scene, and it arguably does a better job than Tullycraft's <em>Twee<&#47;em>. "We'll be the indie stars, that everybody hearts" - I think you already are, guys. I'm still undecided about Help Stamp Out Loneliness&nbsp;and these guys, but they put a very strong case forward. Maybe it'll depend upon the weather.</p>
