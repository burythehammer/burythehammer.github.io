<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, I've already been to Canada. Toronto, in particular, was an electrifying and different experience. It was my first major North American city, and also my first overnight stay, alone. I pretty much threw myself into the deep end, but I figured that since I was in Canada, I might as well appreciate it whilst I could. And I did: I scared myself witless up the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">CN<&#47;span> tower, I got lost in the 6 lane traffic and zipping trams (sorry, streetcars), I marveled at the buildings lit up at night. As a result I didn't really get a true picture of the city, because I was still adjusting to how <span style="font-style: italic;">alien<&#47;span> the entire place seemed.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Because, Toronto, for all I thought it was boring and lifeless before, is a happening place. It also has very strong streaks of home compared to most large cities in the US. Queen Street is a good example. It's basically an above average high street in London, full of independent shops selling all manner of things. But it isn't a strip mall. It's in the middle of a city. It's meant to be walked down, your car parked somewhere else. There are restaurants, and bars, and it's outside.<br &#47;><br &#47;>This seems a pretty boring thing to get excited about, but this just <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't exist<&#47;span> in the USA, for the most part. People go to out of town malls, to rows of shops with masses of parking spaces right outside. You can't walk to, or around, these places. You live through your car. The centre of town is where people go to work, not to drink or to shop. Even Chicago was like this to an extent - I ask my friend, Jessa, anywhere downtown to drink, the response is somewhat along the lines of "nobody drinks downtown". It's all in the neighbourhoods.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Toronto is different in other ways. As mentioned in my last post, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">th<&#47;span>ere is a massive <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">chinese<&#47;span> population. Chinatown is expansive and not designed for tourists, but for first or second generation immigrants. The public transport is <span style="font-style: italic;">good<&#47;span>. There are things happening downtown: loads of trendy bars (the likes of which Mark and I sort of looked at one another and thought, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">hmm<&#47;span>, ain't got the money for that). Whilst I was in the city I was lucky enough to be able to go to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.torontocomics.com&#47;tcaf&#47;"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">TCAF<&#47;span><&#47;a>, which only happens once every two years. It's a comics festival. Mark wasn't particularly happy, but me? I'm not into my comics, but what I am certainly into is <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">webcomics<&#47;span>. A lot of artists I highly respect were there, including:<br &#47;><br &#47;>Ryan North from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.qwantz.com&#47;">Dinosaur Comics<&#47;a><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6"><&#47;span>. There are six strips which stay static every time, only the dialogue changing. The genius is the combination of his insight into various topics, often quite deep (like the nature of happiness, economic systems, and quite detailed scientific papers), and his surreal sense of humour. I can honestly say I've learnt quite a lot over the years through T-rex.<br &#47;><br &#47;>John Campbell from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.picturesforsadchildren.com">Pictures for Sad Children<&#47;a>. He has a very, VERY dry and black sense of humour. It is difficult to convey how funny I find this comic, but it seems to relay it through a sense of eternal disappointment with everything, ever.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Joey and Emily from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.asofterworld.com">A Softer World<&#47;a>, again a very black sense of humour. Emily takes photos, usually blurred and set over various panels. Joey writes captions over them, usually about the people in them, or from an unseen narrator who has something to do with the picture. Not necessarily always funny, but very, very unique.<br &#47;><br &#47;>And Kate Beaton, who writes <a href="http:&#47;&#47;harkavagrant.com&#47;">Hark, A Vagrant<&#47;a>. She actually won an award at this show. She writes comics about historical figures and sometimes autobiographical ones, about adult kate and child kate talking to one another. The historical figures usually act ridiculously and completely out of character. A personal highlight is Napoleon's wife cheating on him, to which he begins to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;harkavagrant.com&#47;index.php?id=136">binge on cookies and cry<&#47;a>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I also saw some other people and saw a lot of very well written comics that I had neither the time to look at nor the money to buy. I felt kind of bad, because an incredible amount of time and effort seems to go into something that not many people appreciate. And here I am going on about someone who merely changes the words of talking dinosaurs.</p>
