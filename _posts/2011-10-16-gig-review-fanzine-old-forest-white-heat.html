<p>I'm reviewing <em>White Heat<&#47;em>&nbsp;now? Christ alive, Matthew, get a grip on yourself. You're way too hipster for this kind of thing.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5357.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" title="Stuart and Lee" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5357.jpg" alt="Stuart and Lee" width="1024" height="768" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>It's the start of the academic year, and with that comes society outings. During my undergraduate years - which seemed like about ten billion years ago - I was involved heavily in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;altmusicimperial.wordpress.com&#47;">Alt Music Society<&#47;a> at Imperial, which pretty much amounts to a society of hipsters. White Heat was one of the most reliable venues to come to, so current president Lee (far left) and treasurer Stuart (centre left) decided to come here for his first society outing of the year.</p>
<p>In typical mistakes that AMS presidents do, we were the first people there by several hours. I could have been drinking cheap beer down the road instead, but no..</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5360.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-529" title="Old Forest" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5360.jpg" alt="Old Forest" width="1024" height="768" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>After <strong>Old Forest<&#47;strong>&nbsp;were done playing their first song, they got my attention, though sadly not in a particularly good way. It was loud, it was boring, and they looked about 15. Now, I don't really mind any of those things (well, let's ignore boring for now). Loud is awesome when you've got awesome music - they didn't. And, if anything it's a boon for them that they're playing White Heat at such an early age. But I was bored.<span style="direction: ltr;">&nbsp;By their second song, I was on my way to the toilet, and by their third or forth song I wasn't even really aware they were playing their third or forth song.<&#47;span></p>
<p>On the second to last piece though, something happened. I glanced across to the person next to me to see whether they'd noticed. A tempo shift! They can make different sounding music. Next they might make it into a melody (<em>okay enough cruel comments. - Ed).<&#47;em></p>
<p>Credit due where credit's due, their last song was great. The terrible, incoherent singing ended <em>(You're fired. - Ed)<&#47;em>,&nbsp;and they started playing what sounded like pretty alright post-rock. It had energy, it had a never-ending crescendo, and although the guitarist was obviously not quite as good as he thought he was, it sounded excellent. It should be a good pointer of where the band's strengths lie that they can pull that off, and given their youth, they've got plenty of time to develop their sound further.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5373.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-530" title="Fanzine" src="http:&#47;&#47;localhost:8888&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;10&#47;DSCF5373.jpg" alt="Fanzine" width="1024" height="768" &#47;><&#47;a>Of course, the highlight of the evening was <strong>Fanzine<&#47;strong>. Drawing from the slacking tradition of late 80s&#47;early 90s alt rock bands such as Big Star or Dinosaur Jr, their music is easily enjoyable and doesn't take a lot of effort.&nbsp;Being ignorant of the band made it all the more pleasant a surprise how good they sounded. Their name, of course, echoes Teenage Fanclub, but that's not where the similarities end. Fanzine's best moments (for this humble indiepop fan) were when they emulated the sweet, subtle melodies of power pop, with understated vocals and clever, subtle melodies. I don't make that comparison lightly -&nbsp;<em>Grand Prix<&#47;em>&nbsp;is one of my favourite albums of all time. Some of their more popular songs didn't seem to quite hit home for me, but this might be just because I prefer one side of their influences more than others.&nbsp;The rest of the AMS were politely rocking out - maybe I'm showing my age when I just had to take a step back and enjoy them.</p>
